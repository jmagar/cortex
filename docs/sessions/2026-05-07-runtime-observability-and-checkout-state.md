# Runtime Observability Session

## User Request

The user reported that syslog-mcp had effectively no runtime observability beyond knowing that some logs were arriving from some devices. The desired direction was to make this observability gap change completely, not just add another superficial health flag.

## Checkout State

This work happened in the primary local checkout:

- Current path: `/home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp`
- Branch: `main`
- Git dir: `.git`
- Worktree list showed this path as the primary worktree.
- A separate linked worktree exists at `.claude/worktrees/oauth-integration` on branch `worktree-oauth-integration`.

When explicitly asked whether the prior work was in a worktree or local checkout, the answer was: local primary checkout, not the linked worktree.

## Beads State

Created and claimed:

- `syslog-mcp-dv79` — `Expose ingestion and runtime observability`

Closed with reason:

> Implemented runtime observability: shared counters/snapshot, listener and writer instrumentation, /health ingest payload, MCP stats/status surfaces, schema/docs/tests. Verified cargo fmt --check, cargo test, cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings.

## Implemented Design

The observability patch added a first-class runtime telemetry surface instead of relying only on DB rows or a generic `/health` result.

Core design:

- Add `RuntimeObservability` as shared runtime state.
- Count UDP packets and bytes received.
- Count TCP connections accepted, active, closed, and rejected.
- Count TCP lines and bytes received.
- Count oversized TCP line drops.
- Count ingest entries enqueued and enqueue errors.
- Track ingest queue depth, queue capacity, and queue utilization percent.
- Count writer batches flushed and logs written.
- Count writer flush failures, retained logs, discarded logs, and storage-blocked state.
- Track `last_ingest_at`, `last_write_at`, and `last_error_at`.

The patch wired those counters through:

- `src/observability.rs` — new snapshot/counter type.
- `src/ingest.rs` — instrumented `IngestTx` wrapper.
- `src/runtime.rs` — shared observability allocation and propagation into MCP state.
- `src/syslog.rs` and `src/syslog/listener.rs` — listener activity and enqueue reporting.
- `src/syslog/writer.rs` — writer success/failure/retention/drop reporting.
- `src/mcp.rs`, `src/mcp/routes.rs`, `src/mcp/tools.rs`, `src/mcp/schemas.rs` — expose runtime state via `/health`, `stats`, and new `status`.

## Public Surfaces Added

### `/health`

The health response was expanded with an `ingest` object containing the runtime observability snapshot. The endpoint remains lightweight and unauthenticated.

### `syslog action=stats`

The existing stats action was expanded with:

- `runtime_observability`
- `otlp`

This keeps existing DB stats while adding live runtime counters in the same operational payload.

### `syslog action=status`

Added a new lightweight action for dashboards and doctor checks that need runtime state without doing the heavier DB statistics query.

The response includes:

- `status`
- `db_ok`
- `runtime_observability`
- `otlp`

## Tests and Verification From That Patch

Commands run after the observability implementation:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Observed results:

- `cargo fmt --check` passed.
- `cargo test` passed:
  - 196 lib tests
  - 7 main tests
  - 3 `rmcp_compat` tests
  - 1 `stdio_mcp` test
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.

Important implementation correction:

- Initial instrumentation pushed `batch_writer` and `flush_batch` above clippy's argument-count threshold.
- Fixed by introducing a writer context struct instead of suppressing the lint.

## Current Committed State At Save Time

Correction: the observability patch was not lost. It was already committed before this note was written, so it did not appear in `git status --short`.

Evidence:

- Commit: `e322a7a60d63ce3380f6000b525b6c61411897e7`
- Commit summary: `feat: direct CLI commands, runtime observability, plugin deploy hardening (0.13.0)`
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor e322a7a60d63ce3380f6000b525b6c61411897e7 HEAD` returned success.
- `git branch --contains e322a7a60d63ce3380f6000b525b6c61411897e7` listed `main`.
- `git ls-files src/observability.rs` listed `src/observability.rs`.

The current dirty worktree at save time contained unrelated rsyslog deploy edits:

```text
## main...origin/main
 M deploy/README.md
 M deploy/rsyslog/30-swag.conf
 M deploy/rsyslog/35-authelia.conf
 M deploy/rsyslog/36-adguard.conf
 M deploy/rsyslog/40-ai-transcripts.conf
?? deploy/rsyslog/11-imfile.conf
```

Diff summary at save time:

```text
deploy/README.md                      | 12 ++++++++++++
deploy/rsyslog/30-swag.conf           | 17 ++++++++---------

deploy/rsyslog/40-ai-transcripts.conf |  8 +++-----
5 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 25 deletions(-)
```

Those rsyslog deploy edits appear unrelated to the runtime observability patch.

## Current Deploy Diff Summary

The current dirty deploy changes do the following:

- Add deployment instructions for shared `deploy/rsyslog/11-imfile.conf`.
- Replace placeholder SWAG paths with verified squirts paths under `/mnt/appdata/swag/log/...`.
- Replace placeholder Authelia path with `/mnt/appdata/authelia/logs/authelia.log`.
- Replace placeholder AdGuard query log path with `/mnt/appdata/adguard/var/data/querylog.json`.
- Remove per-source `module(load="imfile")` and `MaxMessageSize` settings from source drop-ins.
- Add `FreshStartTail="on"` to file-tail inputs.
- Treat `11-imfile.conf` as the shared imfile loader and MaxMessageSize home.

The untracked `deploy/rsyslog/11-imfile.conf` file was listed but not read during the save flow.

## Files Expected From Observability Patch

If the observability patch needs to be recovered or reapplied, expected touched files were:

- `README.md`
- `docs/mcp/SCHEMA.md`
- `docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`
- `src/observability.rs`
- `src/ingest.rs`
- `src/lib.rs`
- `src/mcp.rs`
- `src/mcp/routes.rs`
- `src/mcp/routes_tests.rs`
- `src/mcp/schemas.rs`
- `src/mcp/schemas_tests.rs`
- `src/mcp/tools.rs`
- `src/mcp/tools_tests.rs`
- `src/runtime.rs`
- `src/syslog.rs`
- `src/syslog/listener.rs`
- `src/syslog/listener_tests.rs`
- `src/syslog/writer.rs`
- `src/syslog/writer_tests.rs`

At save time, those changes were not visible in `git status` because they were already committed in `e322a7a`, which is an ancestor of current `HEAD`.

## Open Questions

- None for the observability patch recovery path; it is present in current `HEAD`.
- Should the current deploy rsyslog changes be preserved, committed, or separated from future observability work?

## Next Steps

1. No recovery is needed for the runtime observability patch.
2. If further modifying observability, verify with:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

3. Keep `syslog-mcp-dv79` closed unless a regression is found.
4. If this session note should be committed, remember that `docs/sessions/` may be ignored in some repo flows and may require `git add -f`.
