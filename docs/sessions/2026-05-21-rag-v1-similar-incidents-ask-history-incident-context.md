## User Request

Execute the P3 epic `syslog-mcp-h6da` (RAG over historical incidents and AI sessions) using the `work-it` skill, with a plan written by the `writing-plans` skill first, followed by inline execution via `executing-plans`.

## Session Overview

Wrote and executed a complete implementation plan for adding three MCP actions — `similar_incidents`, `ask_history`, and `incident_context` — that use FTS5 retrieval to surface historical log clusters and correlated AI session transcripts as structured context bundles. Scoped this as a v1 FTS5-only carve-out (no Qdrant/axon dependency) of the larger `syslog-mcp-h6da` epic spec. All 904 tests pass, lint and format clean, PR #42 created and pushed.

## Sequence of Events

1. Claimed beads issue `syslog-mcp-h6da`, read codebase: `src/db/queries.rs`, `src/app/service.rs`, `src/app/models.rs`, `src/mcp/tools.rs`, `src/mcp/schemas.rs`, `src/cli.rs`, `src/cli/dispatch.rs`, the existing design spec, and key DB structs.
2. Consulted advisor before writing plan — resolved scope conflict (full spec uses axon+Qdrant; this plan is a v1 FTS5 carve-out), identified SQL injection risk in `ask_history` context query that needed parameterized bindings, and surfaced CLI parsing patterns.
3. Invoked `writing-plans` skill to produce a detailed 1688-line plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-21-rag-historical-incidents.md`.
4. Created worktree `feat/rag-historical-incidents` at `.worktrees/rag-incidents`.
5. Consulted advisor again before coding — confirmed `parse_required_timestamp` is `pub(super)` (fine for service.rs), identified `pool_size: 1` deadlock risk in `incident_context_summary`, and confirmed CLI dispatch pattern uses `into_request()` + `run_*` free functions in `src/cli/dispatch.rs`.
6. Implemented Task 1 (DB models), Task 2 (DB queries + tests), Task 3 (db.rs exports), Task 4 (app models), Task 5 (service methods), Task 6 (MCP dispatch + schemas + rmcp_server), Task 7 (CLI — arg structs, parse functions, dispatch, print functions), Task 8 (verification).
7. Fixed bugs discovered during `cargo test`: naming conflict in queries_tests.rs (`make_ai_entry` redefined), `SqlParams::new(1)` off-by-2 bug in `incident_context_summary` error log parameterized query, pool deadlock in `incident_context_summary` (inlined AI session query to avoid second `pool.get()`), `IncidentContextParams.query` field dead-code lint (removed from DB layer, kept in app layer as v2 placeholder), useless `format!()` lint fix.
8. Updated test scaffolding: `rmcp_server.rs` READ_ONLY_ACTIONS, `tools_tests.rs` dispatch harness, `docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`, `docs/mcp/TESTS.md`, `plugins/syslog/skills/cortex/SKILL.md`, `scripts/smoke-test.sh`, `tests/test_live.sh`, `tests/mcporter/test-tools.sh`.
9. Pushed branch, created PR #42. CodeRabbit hit rate limit, no actionable review comments.

## Key Findings

- `src/db/pool.rs:1314`: `StorageConfig::for_test` sets `pool_size: 1`, causing `incident_context_summary` to deadlock when `list_ai_sessions(pool, ...)` was called while a connection was already held — fixed by inlining the AI session SQL using the held `conn`.
- `src/db/queries.rs` `SqlParams::new(1)`: manually pushing `from`/`to` to bindings before calling `push_text` skips index tracking — must use `SqlParams::new(3)` so that `push_text` starts at `?3` instead of `?1` (would overwrite `from`).
- `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs:34`: `READ_ONLY_ACTIONS` const must mirror `SYSLOG_ACTIONS` — new actions must be added here or the scope test `public_read_actions_require_syslog_read_scope` fails.
- `src/mcp/tools_tests.rs:248`: `public_action_references_cover_schema_registry` checks `docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`, `docs/mcp/TESTS.md`, `plugins/syslog/skills/cortex/SKILL.md`, `scripts/smoke-test.sh`, `tests/test_live.sh`, `tests/mcporter/test-tools.sh` for every action in `SYSLOG_ACTIONS` — all six files must be updated when adding actions.
- `GROUP_CONCAT(SUBSTR(message, 1, 256), '|||')` in `similar_incidents_clusters`: the `|||` separator could appear in log messages — acceptable v1 limitation documented.

## Technical Decisions

- **FTS5-only, no Qdrant**: The full spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-rag-incidents-design.md`) uses axon+Qdrant+BM42, but v1 is an explicit FTS5 carve-out. No vector DB dependency added.
- **No `incidents` table**: All cluster computation is done on-the-fly in SQL using a time-bucketing CTE (`CAST(strftime('%s', timestamp) AS INTEGER) / window_secs AS bucket`), avoiding any schema migration.
- **`severity_min` wired in `similar_incidents`**: Rather than leaving the field as dead code (which would fail clippy), the severity filter is fully implemented via `SEVERITY_LEVELS[..=threshold]` inclusion filter in the FTS5 CTE.
- **`query` removed from `IncidentContextParams` (DB layer)**: The `query` FTS5 filter for `incident_context` is deferred to v2 (would require a JOIN with `logs_fts` on the error_logs subquery). Field kept in `IncidentContextRequest` (app layer) so callers can pass it without error.
- **CLI dispatch is LOCAL-only for all 3 new actions**: HTTP-capable dispatch is a larger engineering effort; the three new RAG actions bail with a descriptive message in HTTP mode, consistent with the `doctor`, `index`, `add`, `smoke_watch` pattern.
- **Parameterized bindings for all string filters**: The advisor flagged the original plan's string interpolation for `hostname`/`app_name` in `ask_history`'s context query. All string filters use `push_text` → `?N` parameterized bindings.

| `incident_context error_logs query failed` (test panic) | `SqlParams::new(1)` started index tracking at 1, but two bindings were manually pushed (for `from` and `to`) before `push_text` was called — first severity placeholder `?1` incorrectly referenced `from` | Changed to `SqlParams::new(3)` with a clarifying comment |
| `timed out waiting for connection` (test panic) | `incident_context_summary` called `list_ai_sessions(pool, ...)` while already holding a pool connection; test pool has `pool_size: 1` | Inlined AI session SQL query using the already-held `conn` |

| `field query is never read` (clippy) | `query` in `IncidentContextParams` was defined but FTS5 join was deferred to v2 | Removed field from DB layer (`IncidentContextParams`), kept in app layer (`IncidentContextRequest`) with comment |
| `useless use of format!` (clippy) | `format!("WITH hits AS (...)"` had no format placeholders | Changed to `String::from(...)` |
| `schema action similar_incidents did not dispatch: query is required` | Test harness sends `json!({"action": action})` with no required args | Added special cases in `schema_actions_are_dispatchable` for 3 new actions |
| `docs/mcp/TOOLS.md missing action reference for similar_incidents` | `public_action_references_cover_schema_registry` checks 6 files for all `SYSLOG_ACTIONS` entries | Updated all 6 files (TOOLS.md, TESTS.md, SKILL.md, smoke-test.sh, test_live.sh, test-tools.sh) |
| `action=similar_incidents must require syslog:read` | `READ_ONLY_ACTIONS` in `rmcp_server.rs` not updated | Added 3 new actions to `READ_ONLY_ACTIONS` const |

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

**Before:** The `syslog` MCP tool had no RAG-style retrieval actions. Agents had to compose `search` + `search_sessions` manually with no structured bundling.

**After:**
- `syslog similar_incidents` — given a query, returns time-windowed incident clusters from system logs, each with severity peak, representative messages, and overlapping AI sessions
- `syslog ask_history` — given a query, returns AI sessions ranked by match count with system log context from the top session's time window
- `syslog incident_context` — given `from`/`to`, returns a full context bundle: total logs, by-severity, by-app, error rows, active AI sessions
- CLI: `syslog ai similar <query>`, `syslog ai ask-history <query>`, `syslog ai incident-context --from X --to Y`

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| `cargo test` | 904 pass, 0 fail | 904 passed, 1 ignored | PASS |
| `just lint` | No errors | No issues found | PASS |
| `cargo fmt --check` | No diff | No output | PASS |
| `cargo test -- similar_incidents_clusters_returns_clusters` | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `cargo test -- incident_context_summary_returns_window_stats` | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `cargo test -- ask_history_sessions_returns_session_hits` | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `cargo test -- schema_actions_are_dispatchable` | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `cargo test -- public_action_references_cover_schema_registry` | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `cargo test -- public_read_actions_require_syslog_read_scope` | PASS | PASS | PASS |

## Risks and Rollback

- **`GROUP_CONCAT` separator**: `|||` separator in `similar_incidents_clusters` can appear in log messages; this would corrupt `representative_messages` splitting. Low risk for typical syslog content. Fix in v2: use SQLite JSON aggregation or a less common separator.
- **`find_correlated_sessions_in_window` correlated subquery**: The inner `SELECT message FROM logs WHERE ... LIMIT 1` runs once per session group found. On 4.9M rows with many concurrent sessions in a window, this could be slow. Acceptable for v1 (up to 5 sessions per cluster, 10 clusters).
- **Rollback**: Revert PR #42. No schema migrations were applied; no data is mutated. The three new actions can be disabled by removing their dispatch arms in `tools.rs` and their names from `SYSLOG_ACTIONS`.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Qdrant/axon integration**: The full spec calls for dense + BM42 hybrid retrieval via axon and LLM synthesis via `axon ask`. Deferred to v2 — adds external service dependency and complexity not needed for baseline retrieval utility.
- **`incidents` SQLite table**: The spec's "incident card" concept (persist incident summaries to a table) was not implemented. On-the-fly computation from existing FTS5 is sufficient for v1 and avoids schema migration + ingest-side changes.
- **Embedding LLM synthesis**: The spec's `ask_history` action would call axon for Gemini synthesis with citations. v1 returns raw context bundles; the calling agent performs synthesis. This is the right split of concerns for a query-only MCP tool.
- **`query` filter for `incident_context`**: FTS5 filtering of error_logs in `incident_context` was designed in but deferred — would require a JOIN with `logs_fts` on the parameterized severity+window query, adding complexity. Field accepted at app layer, ignored at DB layer.

## Open Questions

- CodeRabbit hit rate limit on PR #42 — no automated code review was produced. A manual review pass or waiting for the next CodeRabbit cycle is needed.
- The `|||` separator in `GROUP_CONCAT` for representative messages should be replaced before v2; SQLite `json_group_array` is the clean fix.
- `incident_context`'s `query` field is accepted at the MCP/app layer but silently ignored. Should the tool return a warning when `query` is provided but not applied?

## Next Steps

**In-progress (started, not merged):**
- PR #42 open, awaiting review and merge

**Follow-on (not started):**
- v2: Wire axon+Qdrant dense retrieval on top of this FTS5 layer (spec §2 architecture)
- v2: Add `incidents` table + trigger detector + signature hasher for structured incident cards
- v2: Wire `query` FTS5 filter in `incident_context_summary` (defer: needs `JOIN logs_fts` on error_logs subquery)
- v2: Add `suggest_fix` and `mark_incident_resolved` actions from the full spec
- Performance: Rewrite `find_correlated_sessions_in_window` to avoid correlated subquery (use `MAX(message) FILTER (WHERE ...)` or a lateral join pattern)
