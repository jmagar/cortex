pr: 56 — feat: complete CLI/API/MCP route parity (3 new routes + 3 unblocked) — https://github.com/jmagar/syslog-mcp/pull/56 (merged)

## User Request

Three sequential prompts in one session: (1) audit CLI/API/MCP feature parity; (2) use `superpowers:writing-plans` to draft a plan for all remaining API-relevant routes; (3) execute via `/work-it` and then `/quick-push` to merge to main and clean up all worktrees and merged branches.

## Session Overview

Performed a three-surface parity audit, wrote a 7-task TDD plan, executed it in an isolated git worktree via `superpowers:executing-plans`, ran three independent review waves (lavra-style reviewers, simplifier passes, pr-review-toolkit), resolved every actionable finding plus the Codex P2 bot review plus 3 CodeRabbit minor comments, then version-bumped 0.34.0 → 0.35.0, merged PR #56 as a fast-forward into main, and cleaned up all worktrees and stale local/remote branches. Final state: main at `f1ac602`, clean, in sync with origin, no worktrees other than the primary checkout, no merged-but-not-deleted branches.

## Sequence of Events

1. **Parity audit.** Dispatched a general-purpose agent to enumerate `ACTION_SPECS`, `/api/*` routes, and CLI verbs. Produced a 41-row matrix.
2. **Audit correction during plan authoring.** Noticed the agent missed that `search_sessions` IS on HTTP as `/api/ai/search`, and missed `fleet_state` entirely (service method existed but unexposed).
3. **Plan written.** Saved `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-api-route-parity-completion.md` with 7 TDD tasks.
4. **Worktree created.** `git worktree add -b feat/api-route-parity-completion .worktrees/api-route-parity HEAD`.
5. **Plan executed.** A general-purpose agent ran the plan task-by-task via `superpowers:executing-plans`. One deviation: `/api/context` returned 500 instead of the planned 400/404 because the service used `anyhow::anyhow!`; tests pinned to current behaviour with `TODO(follow-up)` markers per the plan's own guidance.
6. **PR #56 opened.** `gh pr create` started external review timers.
7. **Wave 1 review (4 parallel agents).** architecture (clean), security (medium: `since` timestamp), silent-failure (medium: missing `http_or_cancel`), code-reviewer (clean). Fix agent applied all 3 in 3 commits.
8. **Wave 2 (3 simplifier passes).** Collapsed `HostStateQuery`/`FleetStateQuery` (−34 LOC), trimmed test name suffixes, fixed inline formatting in `smoke-test.sh`.
9. **Wave 3 (3 pr-review-toolkit roles).** test-analyzer (4 coverage gaps), comment-analyzer (stale 41-actions count), type-design (drop `ContextQuery`, reclassify `fleet_state` cost). Fix agent landed all 8 in 4 commits.
10. **Codex P2.** Bot review flagged the documented `/api/context` 500 issue. Decided to fix in-PR rather than defer; reshaped `SyslogService::context` to return `ServiceError::InvalidInput`/`NotFound`, flipped pinned tests from 500 → 400/404.
11. **CodeRabbit minor (3 comments).** Hardened `wiremock` tests with `query_param` matchers; updated plan snippets (`Cost::Moderate` → `Expensive`, `/api/context` status codes) to match final state.
12. **Saved session log.** Wrote `docs/sessions/2026-05-27-api-route-parity-completion.md` inside the worktree, committed and pushed.
13. **Quick-push: version bump.** 0.34.0 → 0.35.0 in `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, `server.json` (both `version` and OCI tag). Added `## [0.35.0] - 2026-05-27` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
14. **PR merged.** `gh pr merge 56 --merge --delete-branch` — fast-forward merge into main (no merge commit because main hadn't diverged).
15. **Cleanup.** Removed `.worktrees/api-route-parity` worktree, empty `.worktrees/bd-work/` and `.worktrees/` parents, local merged branches (`feat/api-route-parity-completion`, `bd-work/heartbeat-post-v1-fleet-state`, `bd-work/watch-status-p1-p2-fixes`), and the 3 remote branches (`feat/...` and 2× `bd-work/...`).

## Key Findings

- `/api/ai/search` (`src/api.rs:247`) already exposes `search_sessions`; original audit treated it as a gap.
- `SyslogService::fleet_state` existed in `src/app/service.rs:527` since commit `afd77e4` but was never registered as an MCP action — biggest real gap.
- `SyslogService::host_state` (`src/app/service.rs:505`) forwarded `req.since` raw to a SQL `sampled_at >= ?2` lexicographic comparison, bypassing the `parse_optional_timestamp` discipline used by every other timestamp-bearing method.
- `SyslogService::fleet_state` (`src/app/service.rs:534-538`) issues N+1 DB calls; `Cost::Moderate` was dishonest — reclassified to `Cost::Expensive`.
- Three `--http` arms in `src/cli/dispatch_ai.rs` (`run_ai_similar_incidents`, `run_ai_ask_history`, `run_ai_incident_context`) had stale `bail!("...currently runs locally only...")` guards; the matching REST routes had existed since the 2026-05-22 surface-parity gap closure.
- The registry-coverage fence (`src/mcp/tools_tests.rs:public_action_references_cover_schema_registry`) requires every action in `ACTION_SPECS` to be mentioned across 5 docs + 3 scripts; only `just test` enforces it, `cargo check` is silent on this.

## Technical Decisions

- **Bumped 0.34.0 → 0.35.0 (minor)** because the PR is a feature add (3 new HTTP routes + 1 new MCP action). No breaking changes — `host_state` behaviour change (raw `since` → validated) is strictly tightening.
- **Fixed the `/api/context` 500-vs-400/404 follow-up in-PR** rather than deferring. The fix used the same sentinel-error pattern as `host_state` and was 15 LOC; deferring would have shipped a route returning 500 for known client errors.
- **No CLI verbs added** for `host_state`, `context`, `fleet_state` this round. Scope strictly "API routes"; operator UIs consume HTTP directly.
- **Worktree owned pre-existing issues** per work-it protocol — added `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to `UnaddressedErrorsQuery` even though it was pre-existing drift.
- **Deferred** the `HostLookup` enum refactor for `HostStateRequest` per the type-design reviewer's explicit call; out of scope for a parity PR and would break URL-encoded query ergonomics.
- **Merge style: `--merge` not `--squash`** to match the recent PR-merge style on this repo (#49, #50); ended up fast-forward because main hadn't moved.

## Beads Activity

No bead activity observed. The session did not run any `bd` commands; the work flowed through the `/work-it` and `/quick-push` skills with GitHub PR review threads serving the same purpose. The Codex bot suggested filing a bead for the `/api/context` follow-up, but the follow-up was resolved in-PR instead. The `Beads recent issues` and `Beads recent interactions` injection contains pre-existing activity from earlier sessions, none of which was modified here.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans.** Examined `docs/plans/` (5 pre-existing plan files, all from earlier sessions: `2026-03-29-unifi-cef-hostname-fix`, `2026-05-04-rmcp-stdio-support-follow-up`, `2026-05-04-rmcp-streamable-http-refactor`, `2026-05-11-mnemo-feature-port`, `2026-05-12-compose-lifecycle-cli`). Did not move them — completion status is unknown to this session, and the repo has no `docs/plans/complete/` convention (verified with `ls docs/plans/complete/` → not found). The plan I authored (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-api-route-parity-completion.md`) lives in the parallel `docs/superpowers/plans/` tree which similarly has no `complete/` subdir; leaving it in place.
- **Beads.** No-op. No beads created, claimed, closed, or commented on. Documented as `No bead activity observed`.
- **Worktrees and branches.** Cleaned up. `git worktree list` confirms only the primary `~/workspace/syslog-mcp` checkout remains. Local branches: only `main`. Remote branches (verified via `gh api repos/jmagar/syslog-mcp/branches`): only `main`. The empty `.worktrees/bd-work/` and `.worktrees/` parent directories left by an earlier session were also removed (`rmdir`).
- **Stale docs.** Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (added 0.35.0 release entry), `docs/INVENTORY.md`, `docs/mcp/SCHEMA.md` (count bump + `fleet_state` row), `docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`, `docs/mcp/TESTS.md`, `plugins/syslog/skills/syslog/SKILL.md` (fence-required mentions). No other stale docs were observed in scope of the PR. The `CLAUDE.md` at the worktree root references `Version: 0.29.0` in its header table; this is decorative and intentionally lags. Out of scope for this session.
- **Transparency.** Every cleanup action above was verified by command output; nothing was inferred. The `gh pr merge` step printed a stderr error about main being checked out by another worktree, but `gh pr view 56` confirmed the GitHub-side merge completed before the error was raised — documented in "Errors Encountered".

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills:** `superpowers:writing-plans` (plan authoring), `superpowers:executing-plans` (run by implementation agent inside the worktree), `vibin:save-to-md` (worktree session log + this session log), `work-it` (orchestration), `quick-push` (merge + cleanup).
- **Subagents:** 1 general-purpose for the parity audit; 1 general-purpose implementation agent in the worktree; 4 wave-1 reviewers (`lavra:review:architecture-strategist`, `lavra:review:security-sentinel`, `code-reviewer`, `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter`); 3 simplifier passes (`code-simplifier`); 3 wave-3 reviewers (`pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`, `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer`, `pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer`); 3 fix agents (general-purpose); 1 Codex P2 fix agent (general-purpose); 1 CodeRabbit minor fix agent (general-purpose).
- **External CLIs:** `git` / `rtk git` (worktree mgmt, commits, branch/remote cleanup), `cargo` / `rtk cargo check` (build verification), `just` (test, lint), `gh` (PR creation, comment fetch, merge, branch deletion).
- **MCP servers / tools:** None invoked directly this session.
- **Monitor tool:** Used twice to await CI green on PR #56 — once after wave-3 fixes (timed out at 10 min; CI continued in background), once after the version bump (settled within the budget with all 12 checks passing).
- **Issues encountered:** (1) `gh pr merge --delete-branch` errored when run from inside the worktree because main was checked out by the parent worktree — the merge itself succeeded on GitHub but local fast-forward was blocked. Recovered by cd'ing to the parent checkout and pulling. (2) Bash sessions did not persist `cd` state — caught early in the work-it implementation phase; resolved by chaining `cd` into every multi-step command. (3) `rtk grep` does not support ripgrep `--type` flags; switched to the `Grep` tool with glob filters. (4) Codex bot left only one inline review comment despite multiple commits; the bot-side environment was missing per a subsequent automatic comment ("create an environment for this repo") — not blocking.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `rtk git worktree add -b feat/api-route-parity-completion .worktrees/api-route-parity HEAD` | created isolated workspace |
| `just test` | 873 → 1180 tests passing across the session |
| `just lint` | clippy `-D warnings` clean throughout |
| `rtk gh pr create --title ... --body ...` | opened PR #56 |
| `rtk gh pr merge 56 --merge --delete-branch` | fast-forward merge, error on local checkout, GitHub-side OK |
| `rtk git fetch --prune` | pruned 3 deleted remote tracking refs |
| `rtk git worktree remove .worktrees/api-route-parity --force` | cleaned up worktree |
| `rtk git branch -d feat/... bd-work/...` (×3) | deleted 3 local merged branches |
| `rtk gh api -X DELETE repos/.../git/refs/heads/...` (×3) | deleted 3 remote branches |

## Errors Encountered

- **`gh pr merge --delete-branch` failed locally with "main is already used by worktree".** Cause: `gh` tries to check out the base branch after merging; since main was held by the parent worktree, the local checkout failed. The GitHub-side merge + remote branch deletion had already completed (verified via `gh pr view 56` → `MERGED`). Resolved by switching to the parent checkout and running `git pull` to bring the merge commit down.
- **Bash `cd` did not persist between tool calls.** Caught when an `rtk git status -sb` showed `## main` instead of the expected feature branch. Fixed by chaining `cd <worktree> && <cmd>` for every multi-step Bash invocation.
- **`rtk grep` rejected ripgrep `--type` flags** because it shells out to system grep, not ripgrep. Switched to the `Grep` tool's glob filter instead.
- **Implementation agent's Task 2 expected status codes drifted from reality** (plan predicted 400/404 for `/api/context`; service used `anyhow!` → 500). Resolved per the plan's explicit "don't paper over in handler" guidance with TODO-marked tests; later fully fixed in-PR by Codex feedback.
- **`http_client_tests.rs` crate-prefix import failed.** Initial attempt used `crate::app::...`; `http_client.rs` is part of the `syslog` binary which consumes `syslog_mcp` as a library, so the correct path is `syslog_mcp::app::...`. Caught at compile time; fixed immediately.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/host-state` | 404 (no route) | 200 + bounded heartbeat state; 400 if no `host_id`/`hostname` or invalid `since`; 404 if host unknown |
| `GET /api/context` | 404 (no route) | 200 + pivot-window logs; 400 if no pivot; 404 if log_id unknown |
| `GET /api/fleet-state` | 404 (no route) | 200 + fleet snapshot, pressure flags, summary counts |
| `syslog ai similar-incidents/ask-history/incident-context --http` | `bail!("...currently runs locally only")` | reaches matching REST route; supports Ctrl-C cancellation |
| MCP action catalog | 41 actions | 42 actions (adds `fleet_state`) |
| `HostStateRequest.since` | forwarded raw to SQL | validated as RFC3339 at service boundary |
| `fleet_state` MCP cost label | `Cost::Moderate` | `Cost::Expensive` (honest about N+1 DB pattern) |
| Crate / plugin / mcpb / server version | 0.34.0 | 0.35.0 |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `just test` | all suites green, 1180 tests | 1180 passed, 1 ignored, 0 failed | pass |
| `just lint` | clippy `-D warnings` clean | clean | pass |
| `rtk cargo check --lib` | no errors or warnings | clean | pass |
| `rtk gh pr checks 56` | 12 passing | 12 passing (Tests, Clippy, cargo-deny, Formatting, MCP Integration, Pre-publish CI gate, Secret Scan, Version Sync, scan, CodeRabbit, GitGuardian, MCP Integration Tests) | pass |
| `rtk gh pr view 56` | MERGED | `state: MERGED`, `mergedAt: 2026-05-28T03:08:41Z` | pass |
| `git status -sb` (post-cleanup) | clean, in sync with origin/main | `## main...origin/main` clean | pass |
| `git worktree list` | only primary checkout | `~/workspace/syslog-mcp f1ac602 [main]` | pass |
| `gh api repos/.../branches` | only main | only main | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- **Three new public HTTP endpoints** widen the API surface. Each is bearer-gated via the forced `AuthPolicy::Mounted` layer in `router()` (`src/api.rs:268-291`). Rollback: revert the merge of PR #56 — `git revert -m 1 <merge-sha>` would back out all 22 commits.
- **`SyslogService::context` error reshape** changes wire-level status codes from 500 to 400/404 for two known client-input cases. Downstream consumers parsing 500 as "service down" would now see 400/404; effectively a strict tightening, no regression expected.
- **`fleet_state` is `Cost::Expensive` and exposed broadly.** Agents that planned around the previous `Moderate` rating (if any) may want to recalibrate. Trivially reversible.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **`HostLookup` enum refactor for `HostStateRequest`** — would express the "exactly one of host_id / hostname" invariant at the type level, but breaks URL-encoded query ergonomics and ripples through CLI + MCP construction sites. Deferred by type-design reviewer; out of scope for a parity PR.
- **CLI verbs for `host-state` / `context` / `fleet-state`** — operator UIs consume the HTTP routes directly; CLI verbs deferred.
- **`--squash` merge** — chose `--merge` (fast-forward) to preserve the 22-commit history with its review trail, matching recent PR style on this repo.
- **`build-and-push` GitHub Action verification** — not run post-merge; will publish `ghcr.io/jmagar/syslog-mcp:v0.35.0` if wired. Out of scope; left as next-step.

## Open Questions

- Should `correlate` (currently `Cost::Moderate`) be similarly audited for cost honesty given `fleet_state`'s reclassification?
- Five pre-existing plans under `docs/plans/` (dates 2026-03-29 through 2026-05-12) — are they complete? This session left them in place because completion status wasn't verifiable here.

## Next Steps

**Unfinished from this session:** none. The PR is merged, version is bumped, cleanup is complete.

**Follow-on tasks not yet started:**
1. Verify the post-merge GitHub Action `build-and-push` published `ghcr.io/jmagar/syslog-mcp:v0.35.0` — `gh run list --limit 5` (recommended immediate next command).
2. If the repo uses git tags for releases, tag `v0.35.0` on `f1ac602`. Otherwise rely on the version bump alone (recent commits suggest tagless releases).
3. Consider a `HostLookup` enum refactor for `HostStateRequest` — file a bead with the type-design reviewer's recommendation.
4. Audit the rest of `ACTION_SPECS` in `src/mcp/actions.rs` for cost-classification honesty, parallel to the `fleet_state` Moderate → Expensive fix.
5. Add CLI verbs (`syslog host-state`, `syslog context`, `syslog fleet-state`) that tunnel via `--http` to the new routes.
6. Triage the 5 pre-existing plans under `docs/plans/` and move completed ones to a new `docs/plans/complete/` directory.
