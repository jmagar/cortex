# Cortex update command session

## User Request

The user wanted a canonical update path for an already configured Cortex server, preferring an operator command like `cortex update` over repeatedly spelling out `cortex setup deploy remote --home /mnt/cache/appdata/cortex tootie`. The user explicitly asked to use `superpowers:writing-plans` and then `vibin:work-it`.

## Session Overview

This session wrote and pushed an implementation plan, created an isolated `.worktrees/cortex-update-command` checkout, implemented the profile-backed `cortex update` workflow, opened PR #132, and ran several review/fix waves. The final review hardening was still dirty at the time this session artifact was saved, so this note records the state immediately before the final code commit.

## Sequence of Events

1. Wrote the plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-cortex-update-command.md` and pushed it on `codex/restore-dookie-session-ingest`.
2. Created the feature worktree `.worktrees/cortex-update-command` on branch `codex/cortex-update-command`.
3. Implemented the update profile, update runner, `cortex update` CLI surface, docs, and tests across focused commits.
4. Opened PR #132 against `codex/restore-dookie-session-ingest`.
5. Ran review waves and follow-up simplification, then addressed findings around client profile preservation, dry-run validation, token handling, remote env read failures, and secret redaction.
6. Ran focused and broad verification: formatting, update/deploy/setup test slices, full library tests, bin tests, integration targets, clippy, doc tests, version sync, and diff hygiene.
7. Saved this session note before the final broad `git add .` step required by `vibin:work-it`.

## Key Findings

- `cortex setup deploy remote --home ... tootie` is a correct low-level primitive, but it is too setup-shaped for routine updates; the operator UX belongs behind `cortex update`.
- Client agent updates originally risked dropping existing optional heartbeat/AI-transcript forwarding settings because the setup env writer did not preserve the full optional key vocabulary (`src/setup/heartbeat_agent.rs:110`, `src/heartbeat_agent.rs:25`).
- Remote agent env reads could fail open because a missing or failed SSH capture was treated like an empty env, which could erase or omit a required heartbeat token (`src/agent_deploy.rs:330`, `src/agent_deploy.rs:396`).
- Client dry-runs could report success for an explicit but nonexistent agent binary; saved profiles also needed validation when loaded, not only when written (`src/update.rs:165`, `src/update.rs:384`).
- The first redaction pass only covered exact Cortex key names; deploy diagnostics needed to redact arbitrary secret-like env assignments (`src/agent_deploy.rs:799`).

## Technical Decisions

- Kept `cortex setup deploy remote` as the explicit install/deploy primitive and added `cortex update` as the repeatable operator path for already configured machines.
- Made update configuration profile-backed so tootie's home path, host, docker command, and journald mode can be remembered once and reused.
- Preserved omitted saved client profile values when rerunning `cortex update config clients`, rather than treating omitted flags as a reset.
- Required existing client heartbeat tokens only for `cortex update clients`; normal `cortex setup deploy agent` remains the repair/install path where a token may be supplied explicitly.
- Centralized optional heartbeat-agent env keys in `heartbeat_agent::OPTIONAL_ENV_KEYS` so setup and deploy update paths preserve the same knobs.

## Beads Activity

| id | title | action(s) | final status at save time | why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `syslog-mcp-jlih1` | Add cortex update operator workflow | Created, claimed, worked | `in_progress` | Tracks the requested update workflow; intentionally left open until final code commit, push, and PR/comment checks complete |

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

Checked `docs/plans` and `docs/superpowers/plans`. The active plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-cortex-update-command.md` was left in place because the PR and final code commit were still active at save time. Older plan files were not moved because they were outside this session's scope and their completion state was not re-proven.

### Beads

Read `bd show syslog-mcp-jlih1 --json`; it was `in_progress` and assigned to Jacob Magar. It was not closed during this artifact commit because the code changes were still dirty.

### Worktrees And Branches

Checked `git worktree list --porcelain`, `git branch -vv`, and `git branch -r -vv`. The main worktree, base worktree, and feature worktree were all active and tied to live branches; no worktree or branch cleanup was safe.

### Stale Docs

Updated `docs/CLI.md` and `docs/mcp/DEPLOY.md` to reflect the new update workflow and the review-driven client token preservation behavior. Broader docs were not changed because the touched docs covered the operator workflow affected by this session.

### Transparency

This session note is committed alone by contract. Code and docs hardening changes remain dirty after this artifact is written and must be committed separately.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills.** `superpowers:writing-plans` for the implementation plan, `vibin:work-it` for worktree/PR/review workflow, and `vibin:save-to-md` for this artifact.
- **Shell and Git.** Used `git`, `cargo`, `gh`, `bd`, `find`, `test`, and standard shell inspection commands.
- **Subagents.** Used implementation, review, silent-failure, PR-test, analyzer, and simplifier agents during the work-it loop; review findings drove the final hardening batch.
- **External CLIs.** Used `gh` for PR state and `bd` for issue tracking.
- **Browser/Web.** No browser or raw web tools were used.

## Commands Executed

| `git diff --check` | Passed with no whitespace errors |

## Errors Encountered

- The setup heartbeat env default test failed after env writing started honoring ambient `RUST_LOG`; fixed by making the test serial and clearing relevant ambient variables.
- `cargo test --tests` produced a truncated/lost final status while rerunning broad integration coverage, so it was not treated as a clean gate; named integration targets were rerun explicitly and passed.
- Review agents identified several non-crashing correctness risks: optional env loss, fail-open remote env reads, insufficient dry-run validation, profile overwrite behavior, and narrow secret redaction. These were addressed in the dirty review-hardening batch.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Server updates | Operator had to repeat `cortex setup deploy remote --home ... tootie` | Operator can configure once and run `cortex update` |
| Server profile | No remembered remote update profile | Profile stores host/home/docker/journald defaults |
| Client profile config | Omitted flags could wipe saved values | Omitted target/docker/journald values preserve previous saved config |
| Client dry-run | Explicit bad binary path could still appear successful | Explicit binary path is validated before deploy planning |
| Client token handling | Remote env read failures could collapse into empty env | Update clients fail closed when required token cannot be preserved |
| Env preservation | Optional heartbeat/AI transcript keys could be dropped | Shared optional key list is preserved through setup and update paths |
| Secret redaction | Only exact Cortex secret keys were redacted | Arbitrary secret-like env assignments are redacted |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo fmt && cargo test update --lib && cargo test agent_deploy::tests --lib && cargo test setup::heartbeat_agent --lib` | Formatting plus focused tests pass | Passed | pass |
| `cargo xtask check-version-sync` | Version-bearing files agree | Passed at 3.9.1 | pass |
| `cargo test --lib` | Library tests pass | 1932 passed, 1 ignored | pass |
| `cargo test --bins` | Binary tests pass | 520 passed, 1 ignored | pass |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | No clippy warnings | Passed | pass |
| `cargo test --doc` | Doc tests pass | 0 doc tests, command passed | pass |
| Named integration target command | Listed integration targets pass | Passed | pass |
| `git diff --check` | No whitespace errors | Passed | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- The final hardening batch was not yet committed at this artifact save point; rollback before the code commit would be `git restore` on the dirty files, preserving the already pushed implementation commits.
- The update-client token requirement may surface previously hidden misconfigured agents; the intended repair path is `cortex setup deploy agent --heartbeat-token ...`, not bypassing the update check.
- The PR targets `codex/restore-dookie-session-ingest`, not `main`, because the current work builds on the earlier dookie session ingest branch.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not rename or remove `setup deploy remote`; it remains the low-level install/deploy primitive for explicit setup work.
- Did not add a token flag directly to `cortex update clients`; update is for already configured agents, while setup deploy remains the repair path for installing or replacing secrets.
- Did not move older plan files to `docs/plans/complete/`; their completion state was not proven during this session.
