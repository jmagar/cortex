## User Request

Test the lab gateway `tool_search` functionality and verify it's working after a session reconnect.

## Session Overview

Short diagnostic session testing the lab MCP gateway's `tool_search` tool across several queries. Discovered that the scorer had been upgraded from a lexical heuristic to hybrid semantic search (Qdrant + TEI + RRF), and updated the global CLAUDE.md to reflect this. No code changes to syslog-mcp itself.

## Sequence of Events

1. User ran `/mcp` to open the MCP dialog — session was dismissed without changes
2. Called `tool_search("syslog logs search query")` — failed with "Session not found" (MCP session had expired)
3. Confirmed the lab gateway itself was healthy via `curl https://lab.tootie.tv/health`
4. User ran `/mcp reconnect lab` (not found), then `/mcp` and reconnected `plugin:lab:lab`
5. Retested `tool_search("syslog logs search query")` — succeeded, returned `syslog` tool at score 28.0
6. Tested `tool_search("password")` — only one low-score result (repomix file reader mentioning password detection); Bitwarden not in gateway
7. Tested `tool_search("nginx")` — hit `index_warming` error on first attempt, returned empty on retry
8. Tested `tool_search("swag")` — clean hit at score 200.0 from `swag` upstream
9. Tested `tool_search("tailscale")` — score 200.0 from `rustscale` upstream
10. Tested `tool_search("unifi")` and `tool_search("unraid")` in parallel — both score 200.0 from `rustifi` and `unrust` respectively
11. User corrected the CLAUDE.md note that the scorer was lexical — "it's not lexical anymore homeboi"
12. Checked `jmagar/lab` recent commits via `gh api` — found `d2899ea` (2026-05-20): "feat(tool-search): hybrid semantic search via Qdrant + TEI with RRF fusion", closing lab#64
13. Updated global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` in two places to reflect the new hybrid scorer
14. Discussed why `tool_search("nginx")` returned empty — semantic gap between "nginx" and swag's description text, not an index warmup issue; corrected earlier imprecise explanation

## Key Findings

- Lab `tool_search` upgraded to hybrid semantic (Qdrant dense vectors via TEI + sparse keyword, RRF fusion) on 2026-05-20 via `jmagar/lab@d2899ea`
- Score 200 = exact tool name match; lower scores = semantic proximity
- `tool_search("nginx")` returns empty because swag's tool description uses "SWAG", "reverse proxy", "subdomain conf" — no "nginx" token — and the semantic similarity isn't high enough to surface it
- Fix: add "nginx" or "nginx reverse proxy" to swag tool's description text
- Bitwarden is not connected through the lab gateway (accessed via `bw` CLI or its own MCP server)
- MCP sessions expire and require reconnect via `/mcp` dialog; `lab gateway` health is independent of session state

## Technical Decisions

- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` `tool_search ranking notes` section to replace lexical heuristic description with hybrid semantic description
- Updated `tool_search — How to Query Effectively` section with corrected examples showing single-word queries now work
- Did not update swag tool description (that's a change to `swag-mcp` repo, out of scope for this session)

## Files Modified

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/home/jmagar/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Updated two sections describing `tool_search` scorer from "lexical heuristic" to "hybrid semantic (Qdrant + TEI + RRF)" |

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Gateway health check
curl https://lab.tootie.tv/health
# → {"status":"ok","mode":"master","pid":7,"uptime_s":10188}

# Recent lab commits

# Key result: d2899ea 2026-05-20 feat(tool-search): hybrid semantic search via Qdrant + TEI with RRF fusion
```

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| CLAUDE.md tool_search docs | Said "lexical heuristic, avoid single words" | Says "hybrid semantic RRF, single words work" |
| Query strategy guidance | Required 2-4 specific intent words | Single words fine; intent phrases improve precision |

## Open Questions

- Why does `tool_search("nginx")` return empty even with semantic search? Is the embedding distance between "nginx" and swag's description truly below threshold, or is there a score floor filtering it out?
- Would adding "nginx" to swag's tool description be sufficient, or does the embedding model need explicit training data to make that association?

## Next Steps

- **Follow-on**: Update `swag-mcp` tool description to include "nginx" and "nginx reverse proxy" so `tool_search("nginx")` surfaces it semantically
