# Docker Socket Proxy Ingest Session

## User Request

Add support for storing Docker container logs from multiple homelab hosts in syslog-mcp without depending on Docker daemon syslog drivers, using existing docker-socket-proxy deployments where appropriate. The work was requested inside a dedicated worktree, with a PR, lavra-review, gh-address-comments, merge to `main`, lavra-learn, session capture, and worktree cleanup.

## Session Overview

- Created and used `/home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp/.worktree/docker-socket-proxy-ingest` on branch `feat/docker-socket-proxy-ingest`.
- Implemented optional Docker socket-proxy log ingestion alongside existing UDP/TCP syslog ingestion.
- Created PR #10, addressed lavra-review findings and GitHub review threads, rebased/merged current `main`, and merged the PR.
- Fast-forwarded the primary `main` worktree to merge commit `84aa5aa`.
- Replaced personal device names in Docker-ingest docs/examples/tests with neutral `edge-host-a` / `app-host-b` placeholders before merge.

## Sequence of Events

1. Set up the feature worktree and copied `.env` plus `config.toml` into it.
2. Researched Docker socket proxy behavior and Docker log streaming requirements.
3. Added Docker ingest config, client, parser, supervisor, checkpointing, and shared ingest writer plumbing.
4. Added SQLite checkpoint persistence in the same transaction as log inserts.
5. Updated deployment/config docs, examples, version metadata, and changelog.
6. Ran lavra-review and fixed findings around durability, reconnect behavior, lifecycle event gaps, insecure HTTP, source identity, and docs.
7. Ran gh-address-comments, replied to review threads, and verified all review threads were resolved or outdated.
8. Resolved later `main` conflicts, pushed merge commit `38dec72` to the feature branch, and merged PR #10 into `main` as `84aa5aa`.

## Key Findings

- Docker daemon syslog driver was not selected because it can couple container runtime behavior to remote log delivery and affects normal Docker logging ergonomics.
- Pulling logs through Docker socket proxy supports central ingestion while preserving local Docker logging behavior.
- Checkpoints must not advance independently of durable log insertion; the final design writes checkpoint metadata in the same SQLite transaction as the log batch.
- Docker log resume uses second-level `since` semantics, so precise RFC3339 checkpoint filtering avoids duplicate replay within a checkpoint second.
- HTTP docker-socket-proxy endpoints are sensitive; insecure HTTP requires explicit per-host `allow_insecure_http = true`.

## Technical Decisions

- Docker ingest is optional and config-gated, so existing syslog UDP/TCP behavior remains unchanged when disabled.
- One shared bounded ingest writer handles both syslog listener input and Docker log input, preserving existing retention/storage guardrail behavior.
- Docker rows use configured Docker host identity as `hostname` and a `docker://<host>/<container>/<stream>` `source_ip` value.
- Container log stream failures reconnect independently with backoff.
- Docker event watching uses a `since` lookback to reduce missed lifecycle events during reconnects.

## Files Modified

- `src/docker_ingest.rs`, `src/docker_ingest/*`: Docker API client, metadata models, log parser, supervisor, and checkpoint helpers.
- `src/ingest.rs`, `src/runtime.rs`, `src/syslog.rs`, `src/syslog/writer.rs`: shared ingest writer wiring for syslog and Docker sources.
- `src/db.rs`, `src/db/ingest.rs`, `src/db/models.rs`, related tests: Docker checkpoint schema and transactional batch insert support.
- `src/config.rs`, `src/config_tests.rs`: Docker ingest config, env vars, hosts file loading, and validation.
- `README.md`, `docs/CONFIG.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, `docs/mcp/ENV.md`: Docker ingest setup/config documentation.
- `config/docker-hosts.example.toml`, `.env.example`, `config.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`: example runtime configuration and volume/env wiring.
- Version/release surfaces: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, `server.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and related publishing/plugin docs.

## Commands Executed

- `cargo fmt --check`: passed after formatting.
- `RUSTC_WRAPPER= cargo check`: passed after conflict resolution.
- `RUSTC_WRAPPER= cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`: passed after conflict resolution.
- `RUSTC_WRAPPER= cargo test -- --test-threads=1`: passed after conflict resolution.
- `docker compose config`: passed during PR verification.
- `bash bin/check-version-sync.sh`: passed with all checked version files at `0.7.0`.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `python3 .../gh-address-comments/scripts/verify_resolution.py --input /tmp/syslog-mcp-pr10-comments.json`: reported all 8 review threads resolved or outdated.
- `gh pr merge 10 --repo jmagar/syslog-mcp --merge --delete-branch --auto`: merged PR #10 after branch update.
- `git merge --ff-only origin/main`: fast-forwarded primary `main` to `84aa5aa`.

## Errors Encountered

- Initial `gh pr merge 10 --merge --delete-branch` failed because `main` had moved and GitHub could not create a clean merge commit.
- Merging `origin/main` into the feature branch produced conflicts in version surfaces, `CHANGELOG.md`, `Cargo.lock`, and test split changes. These were resolved by keeping version `0.7.0`, retaining main's `0.6.1` changelog entry beneath `0.7.0`, and preserving main's sidecar test split.
- Running `gh pr merge` from inside the linked worktree failed because local `main` was already checked out in the primary worktree. Running the merge command remotely with `--repo jmagar/syslog-mcp` from `/tmp` succeeded.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Area | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker logs | Not ingested unless sent through external syslog paths | Optional Docker API log ingestion from configured remote Docker hosts |
| Checkpointing | No Docker checkpoint table | Per host/container checkpoint stored with log insert transaction |
| Remote host config | No Docker hosts file | `SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS_FILE` points to TOML `[[hosts]]` entries |
| HTTP socket proxy | No Docker endpoint validation | Insecure HTTP requires explicit `allow_insecure_http = true` |
| Docs examples | Initially used personal hostnames in Docker ingest examples | Neutral `edge-host-a` and `app-host-b` placeholders |

## Risks and Rollback

- Docker socket proxy exposes Docker control-plane data; deployments should keep the proxy on a trusted network and restrict endpoints to read-only log/container/event APIs.
- Pulling logs from multiple Docker hosts can increase DB write volume; retention and storage guardrails remain important.
- Rollback path: disable Docker ingest with `SYSLOG_DOCKER_INGEST_ENABLED=false` or remove `SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS_FILE`; existing syslog UDP/TCP ingestion remains available.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not use Docker daemon-level syslog driver as the primary plan because it can couple container runtime behavior to remote log delivery and changes Docker logging behavior.
- Did not rename existing registry/domain references such as `tv.tootie/syslog-mcp`; only personal device examples introduced by this PR were neutralized.

## References

- PR #10: https://github.com/jmagar/syslog-mcp/pull/10
- Merge commit: `84aa5aa4b03c244129833c77b3d6ada152bb85c9`
- tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy was packed/embedded earlier for reference during design.
- GitHub review workflow used `gh-address-comments` scripts from the local plugin cache.

## Open Questions

- GitHub checks triggered by the final branch update were still running after the PR merge when last checked: MCP Integration Tests, Security Audit, and build-and-push were pending; local and pre-push tests passed.
- Existing public registry/domain names using `tootie` remain in the repo and were not changed because they appear to be namespace/domain references, not personal device examples.

## Next Steps

- Recheck post-merge GitHub workflows if release/publish status matters.
- Deploy with a real Docker hosts file mounted at `/config/docker-hosts.toml`.
- Keep docker-socket-proxy endpoints private and restricted.
