# Session Save: Syslog Expansion, Runtime Freshness, and Skills

Date: 2026-05-07 08:42 EDT
Repo: `/home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp`
Branch context: working tree is dirty with feature work in progress.

## Summary

This session expanded syslog-mcp deployment coverage and tightened plugin/runtime operations after PR 13 style ingest expansion work. The active deployment on dookie was confirmed to be systemd, not Docker, and the repo/plugin was adjusted to keep systemd as the intended mode.

Major outcomes:

- Deployed/verified rsyslog drop-ins across the fleet, including journald and AI transcript ingestion.
- Confirmed SWAG, Authelia, AdGuard, and AI transcript file locations for squirts-style appdata paths.
- Added configurable ingest queue capacity to absorb journald/transcript bursts.
- Added runtime freshness checking for systemd and Docker.
- Converted plugin slash command surfaces to skills and removed plugin command registration.
- Reviewed all plugin skills with the `skill-creator` workflow and fixed concrete skill quality issues.

## Live Runtime State

Current intended mode: systemd.

Observed state:

- `~/.claude/settings.json` has `use_docker: false`.
- `syslog-mcp.service` is active.
- No `syslog-mcp` Docker container is running.
- Runtime freshness checker reports `CURRENT`.

Fresh checker output evidence:

```text
mode       systemd
unit       syslog-mcp.service
state      active
running_version syslog-mcp 0.14.0
unit_version syslog-mcp 0.14.0
CURRENT: running systemd service matches installed binary
```

Health evidence after queue tuning:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "queue_depth": 1,
  "queue_capacity": 100000,
  "queue_utilization_pct": "0.00",
  "writer_storage_blocked": false
}
```

## Code and Config Changes

### Runtime Freshness

Added `scripts/check-runtime-current.sh`.

Behavior:

- Auto-detects active runtime.
- Systemd mode compares running `/proc/<pid>/exe` hash to the unit `ExecStart` binary hash.
- Docker mode compares the running container image ID to the local compose image ID.
- Docker `--pull` pulls first, then compares; without `--pull`, Docker only proves the running container matches the local image cache.
- Supports `--expected-binary` for comparing a live systemd process to a freshly built binary.

Added `scripts/test-check-runtime-current.sh` for argument/help validation.

Added `syslog --version` support in `src/main.rs`, with a parser test in `src/main_tests.rs`.

### Ingest Queue Capacity

Added configurable queue capacity:

- Config field: `SyslogConfig.write_channel_capacity`
- Env var: `SYSLOG_WRITE_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`
- Default: `10000`
- Live tuning: `SYSLOG_BATCH_SIZE=1000`, `SYSLOG_WRITE_CHANNEL_CAPACITY=100000`

Updated observability/reporting so health exposes:

- queue depth
- queue capacity
- queue utilization

Updated plugin setup to preserve/write:

- `SYSLOG_BATCH_SIZE`
- `SYSLOG_WRITE_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`

This prevents `syslog-redeploy` or SessionStart from silently dropping the live queue tuning.

### Rsyslog Drop-ins

Updated/deployed rsyslog config for:

- journald via `10-imjournal.conf`
- imfile module via `11-imfile.conf`
- SWAG nginx/fail2ban
- Authelia
- AdGuard
- AI transcripts

Important current path assumptions:

- SWAG: `/mnt/appdata/swag/`
- Authelia: `/mnt/appdata/authelia`
- AdGuard/Unbound: `/mnt/appdata/adguard-unbound`
- AI transcripts use normal home locations: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.gemini`

Journald drop-in was updated with `IgnorePreviousMessages="on"` and state was reset during rollout to avoid old journal backlog pegging ingest.

### Plugin Skills

The plugin no longer registers slash commands. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` now points to:

- `mcpServers`: `./plugins/.mcp.json`
- `hooks`: `./plugins/hooks/hooks.json`
- `skills`: `./plugins/skills`

Removed command surfaces:

- `plugins/commands/cutover.md`
- `plugins/commands/deploy-dropins.md`
- `plugins/commands/dr.md`
- `plugins/commands/logs.md`
- `plugins/commands/redeploy.md`
- `docs/plugin/COMMANDS.md`

Added or updated skill surfaces:

- `syslog`
- `syslog-troubleshoot`
- `syslog-report`
- `syslog-dr`
- `syslog-deploy-dropins`
- `syslog-redeploy`
- `syslog-logs`
- `syslog-cutover`
- `syslog-version-check`

Skill review fixes from `skill-creator`:

- Added missing `agents/openai.yaml` for `syslog` and `syslog-troubleshoot`.
- Added MCP dependency metadata for skills that depend on syslog evidence.
- Removed hardcoded source checkout fallback from `syslog-logs`.
- Made `syslog-cutover` discover the installed `syslog@...` plugin config key instead of assuming `syslog@jmagar-lab`.
- Fixed the MCP curl example in `syslog-troubleshoot` to use separate `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers.
- Clarified fleet host parsing in `syslog-deploy-dropins`.

## Verification

Commands run successfully:

```bash
cargo test
just validate-skills
bash -n scripts/check-runtime-current.sh scripts/test-check-runtime-current.sh scripts/plugin-setup.sh
scripts/test-check-runtime-current.sh
scripts/check-runtime-current.sh
jq empty .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

Skill validation:

```bash
for d in plugins/skills/*; do
  python3 /home/jmagar/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py "$d"
done
```

Result: all 9 skills valid.

`agents/openai.yaml` files were parsed and checked for:

- `interface.display_name`
- `interface.short_description`
- `interface.default_prompt`

All present.

## Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Decide whether to commit this full batch as one feature commit or split into:
  - ingest/runtime config
  - rsyslog deployment drop-ins
  - plugin skills conversion
  - runtime freshness checker
- If committing, include this session note intentionally; `docs/sessions/` may be ignored, so force-add if needed.
- Consider adding deeper shell tests for `check-runtime-current.sh` using mocked `systemctl`/`docker` PATH shims if this script becomes central CI surface.
- Consider whether `syslog-dr` should run `check-runtime-current.sh --pull` when configured for Docker and user explicitly asks for latest registry image verification.
