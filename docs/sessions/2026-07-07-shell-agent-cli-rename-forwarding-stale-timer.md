## User Request

Fix bead `syslog-mcp-4n4a6` (the `agent-command` wrapper + self-ingest guard using pre-rename CLI grammar) properly this time: replace the hyphenated `cortex ingest agent-command ingest-spool`/`wrap` grammar with a nested, no-hyphen `cortex ingest shell user|agent ...` structure (mirroring the existing `shell` domain for atuin/zsh history), and — while doing so — also implement the two follow-up decisions the user confirmed: (1) support forwarding the local agent-command spool to a remote production Cortex instead of only writing to a local DB, and (2) let `cortex doctor` detect and optionally retire stale systemd timers still invoking the old grammar. The user then asked for an engineering review of the plan (`lavra-eng-review`), had feedback applied, and asked to run the whole thing to completion via `vibin:work-it` — worktree setup, implementation, mandatory independent review (`lavra-review`), mandatory PR Review Toolkit sweep (`vibin:review-pr`), and session logging.

## Session Overview

Wrote a 14-task, 4-phase implementation plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-06-shell-agent-command-rename-and-forwarding.md`), ran a 4-agent engineering review against the plan and applied 14 of 16 recommendations before implementation started, then executed the full `vibin:work-it` workflow: created an isolated worktree, opened draft PR #123, dispatched an implementation agent that completed all 14 tasks (17 commits, 1868 lib tests + 511 binary tests passing), ran an independent 6-agent code review (`lavra-review`) that found and fixed 3 real issues (a lock held across a network call, a duplicated/drifting grammar-matching pattern, a correctness-risking premature optimization), then ran a 5-agent PR Review Toolkit sweep (`vibin:review-pr`) that found and fixed a real shippable bug (`--token` silently discarded without `--server`), a test that couldn't have caught its own regression, missing auth-path test coverage, and stale documentation. All fixes pushed; branch is green (build/test/fmt/clippy/version-sync all pass); CI running on the final push at session-log time.

## Sequence of Events

1. Investigated 7 in-progress beads at user's request; determined 5 were already fully implemented (closed them), 1 needed a one-line fix (closed after fixing), and 1 (`syslog-mcp-4n4a6`) had a genuinely unresolved design decision described in its own comments.
2. User confirmed both follow-up decisions (forwarding + stale-timer detection) should be built, and specified the CLI naming should nest under `shell` as `user`/`agent` children with no hyphens, plus a `shell completions` install step.
3. Wrote the full implementation plan via `superpowers:writing-plans`, doing deep codebase research (existing `heartbeat_agent.rs`/`heartbeat.rs` POST-then-truncate pattern, `setup/*.rs` phase-based idiom, `surfaces.rs` CLI registry, `systemd.rs` helpers) before drafting.
4. User caught a design misunderstanding (completions should nest under `shell`, not become a new flat hyphenated `shell-completions` command) — corrected the plan's Task 5/6/10 structure.
5. Ran `lavra-eng-review`: dispatched architecture-strategist, code-simplicity-reviewer, security-sentinel, performance-oracle against the plan. Synthesized 3 critical + 6 important + 5 minor findings; applied 14/16 to the plan (skipped 2 low-value structural-churn items with stated reasons).
6. Ran `vibin:work-it`: created worktree `.worktrees/feature-shell-agent-cli-rename` via `vibin:worktree-setup`, copied the plan in, committed it, pushed, opened draft PR #123.
7. Dispatched an implementation agent (`superpowers:executing-plans`) that completed all 14 tasks across 17 commits; reported all-green verification.
8. Independently reconfirmed build/test/fmt/clippy myself; spot-checked the two critical engineering-review fixes (`spawn_blocking`, `MAX_RECORDS_PER_BATCH`) directly in the diff.
9. Ran `lavra:lavra-review`: dispatched 6 review agents (architecture, simplicity ×2 after a retry, security, performance, pattern-recognition) against the actual implementation diff. Several agents initially returned meta-notes about spawning their own sub-agents instead of reviewing directly; retried with explicit no-delegation instructions until real findings came through.
10. Fixed 3 corroborated P2 findings from that review directly: released the exclusive spool lock before the network POST in `forward_agent_command_spool` (was held across the whole request, up to a 30s timeout — would have stalled every concurrent `ingest shell agent wrap` invocation on the host); extracted shared argv-shape-matching primitives so the self-ingest guard and the doctor stale-unit detector can't drift apart; dropped an unrequested unit-name pre-filter in `doctor.rs` that could silently produce a false all-clear. Added a new regression test for the lock fix. Filed 3 pre-existing findings as standalone backlog beads. Logged LEARNED/PATTERN knowledge against bead `syslog-mcp-4n4a6`. Committed and pushed.
11. Ran `vibin:review-pr`: dispatched 5 PR Review Toolkit agents (code-reviewer, pr-test-analyzer, comment-analyzer, silent-failure-hunter, type-design-analyzer) against PR #123.
12. Fixed every actionable finding: a real shippable bug (`--token` without `--server` silently discarded — type-design-analyzer), a regression test that never actually exercised the lock it claimed to prove was fixed (pr-test-analyzer), missing `AuthPolicy::LoopbackDev`/no-token-configured auth test coverage (pr-test-analyzer), a stale `docs/CLI.md` section never updated by the rename (comment-analyzer), and a stale startup warning message omitting the new endpoint (code-reviewer). Extracted the dispatch-precedence decision into a pure, directly-unit-tested function as part of the fix. Committed and pushed.
13. Reran full verification (1868 lib tests + 511 binary tests, fmt, clippy, version-sync — all green). Wrote this session log.

## Key Findings

- `src/command_log.rs:398-449` (pre-fix): `forward_agent_command_spool` held its exclusive `flock` via one open `File` across the entire `.await` chain, including a 30s-timeout network POST — since `ingest shell agent wrap` takes the same lock to append each command record, a slow-but-not-dead remote would have stalled every concurrent wrapped shell command on the host. Root cause: the design (in my own plan) mirrored the local-import path's lock-for-whole-operation pattern without accounting for network latency.
- `src/command_log.rs` and `src/setup/doctor.rs` (pre-fix) independently reimplemented identical basename+argv-shape matching for the same CLI grammar shapes — a future grammar change would need to be made in two places, with no compiler-enforced link between them.
- `src/setup/doctor.rs` (pre-fix) had an unrequested `unit_name_plausibly_agent_command_related` substring pre-filter (`cortex`/`agent`/`command` in unit *name*) before `systemctl cat`-ing each candidate unit — could silently produce a false all-clear for a renamed drain unit (e.g. `spool-drain.timer`).
- `src/main.rs:141-167` (pre-fix): `ingest shell agent index --token secret` with no `--server` anywhere (global or per-command) fell through to the local-import path, which never reads `args.token` at all — the token was parsed, stored, and silently discarded with zero error. Found by `type-design-analyzer` tracing the actual dispatch control flow, not just the type shapes.
- `src/command_log_tests.rs` (pre-fix): the regression test for the lock-scope fix spawned a concurrent "appender" using a bare `std::fs::OpenOptions` write instead of the crate's real `append_spool_record` (which takes the same `flock`) — it would have passed identically whether or not the lock fix was reverted, since nothing on the append side ever contended for the lock.
- `docs/CLI.md:678-685`: the `### cortex ingest shell` section was never touched by the rename and still documented the now-broken bare `cortex ingest shell index`/`shell atuin-index` invocations (parser now requires the `user` token).
- Confirmed via `git show main:src/setup/agent_command.rs` that `validate_agent_command_binary`'s blocking `Command::output()` call (flagged by 3 review agents as a possible new regression) actually predates this PR verbatim — filed as pre-existing backlog, not fixed in this PR.

## Technical Decisions

- Nested CLI restructure (`ingest shell {user,agent}`, `setup shell {agent,completions}`) chosen over a flat hyphenated `shell-agent`/`shell-completions` per explicit user correction, avoiding both new hyphens and a naming collision with the pre-existing `heartbeat_agent`/fleet-deploy "agent" concept.
- Kept the CLI parser tolerant of exactly one legacy grammar shape (`ingest agent-command ingest-spool`/`wrap`, the one actually deployed on `dookie`) rather than three, after `lavra-eng-review`'s simplicity pass identified the third ("pre-move," two renames back) shape as provably unreachable through the CLI's own top-level parser.
- Forwarding reuses the exact `/v1/heartbeats` auth/body-limit/router pattern (`is_authorized`, `RequestBodyLimitLayer`, `AuthPolicy` matching) rather than inventing a new auth model, per architecture review guidance to measure new code against an already-shipped baseline.
- Stale-timer detection in `doctor.rs` stays a read-only/`--fix --yes`-gated scan reusing existing `setup/systemd.rs` helpers, explicitly rejecting a fuller systemd-timer-lifecycle-management feature (mirroring `sessions_watch.rs`'s depth) as out of scope for a "lightweight" ask.
- Chose to extract shared argv-classifier primitives (`cortex_argv_program_matches`, `is_current_shell_agent_index_argv`, `is_grouped_legacy_agent_command_argv`, `is_bare_legacy_agent_command_argv`) as plain functions rather than a single enum-returning classifier (which `type-design-analyzer` suggested as the "best design-quality win for the effort") — deferred that follow-up refactor rather than doing it mid-review-cycle, since the plain-function extraction already achieves the review's stated goal (no more drift between the two call sites) and the enum refactor is optional polish, not a correctness fix.
- Extracted `resolve_shell_agent_index_dispatch` as a pure function (rather than adding an integration test that mocks `RuntimeCore`) specifically so the precedence rules (per-command `--server` overrides global, `--http` without a resolvable server bails, `--token` without a resolvable server now bails) are unit-testable without heavy test infrastructure.

## Beads Activity

- `syslog-mcp-4n4a6` (P1, `agent-command wrapper + self-ingest guard use pre-rename CLI grammar`): 4 knowledge comments added (LEARNED: lock-scope bug root cause; PATTERN: shared argv-classifier extraction; LEARNED: dropped prefilter rationale; INVESTIGATION: full review summary with fix disposition). Left open — should be closed by the user once verified live on `dookie` (regenerate wrapper via `cortex setup shell agent install`, then `cortex doctor --fix --yes` or manual review to retire the stale timer).
- `syslog-mcp-7j61f` (P3, created): `validate_agent_command_binary` blocking `Command::output()` in async fn — confirmed pre-existing (predates PR #123), filed standalone, not blocking.
- `syslog-mcp-q6a2j` (P3, created): `entry_exists` check-then-insert dedup race, now network-exposed via `/v1/agent-commands` — pre-existing logic, filed standalone.
- `syslog-mcp-uail9` (P4, created): merged-router test only covers 2 of ~6 routers chained in `serve_mcp()` — test-coverage gap, filed standalone.
- Earlier in the session (before this plan/PR work began): closed `syslog-mcp-hk5wg`, `syslog-mcp-0gh4f`, `syslog-mcp-tf6tv`, `syslog-mcp-o7a7p`, `syslog-mcp-usjz9` (all confirmed already-implemented via code/test audit) and `syslog-mcp-i9kr` (fixed the one remaining straggler string, then closed) as part of the earlier "investigate the 7 in-progress beads" request in this same session.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: `docs/plans/` (the repo's other, separate plans directory — distinct from `docs/superpowers/plans/` used by this session) was not touched; its existing entries predate this session and are unrelated. The plan this session wrote (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-06-shell-agent-command-rename-and-forwarding.md`) is now fully implemented but was left in place rather than moved to a `complete/` subfolder, since `docs/superpowers/plans/` has no such convention observed in this repo (only `docs/plans/complete/` exists, for the other directory). Flagging as a possible follow-up if the user wants a similar completed-plan archive convention for `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- **Beads**: see Beads Activity above — 3 new backlog beads filed, 4 knowledge comments logged against the target bead, all directly evidenced by the review findings that produced them.
- **Worktrees and branches**: `.worktrees/feature-shell-agent-cli-rename` is active, has unpushed-nothing (fully pushed), and is the working location for PR #123 — left in place, not cleaned up, since the PR is still open (draft) and CI/further review may follow. No other stale worktrees or branches found (`git worktree list` shows only `main` and this worktree).
- **Stale docs**: `docs/CLI.md`'s `### cortex ingest shell` section fixed (was stale, now updated — see Key Findings). No other stale-doc issues surfaced by the 11 review agents across both review waves.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills**: `superpowers:writing-plans` (plan authoring), `lavra:lavra-eng-review` (plan review), `vibin:worktree-setup` (worktree creation/sync), `vibin:review-pr` (PR Review Toolkit sweep), `lavra:lavra-review` (independent code review), `vibin:quick-push` (this wrap-up), `vibin:save-to-md` (this document). All completed successfully; no skill failures.
- **Subagents**: `lavra:review:architecture-strategist`, `lavra:review:code-simplicity-reviewer`, `lavra:review:security-sentinel`, `lavra:review:performance-oracle`, `lavra:review:pattern-recognition-specialist` (both plan-review and code-review passes); `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`, `pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`, `pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer`, `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter`, `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer`; one general implementation agent (`superpowers:executing-plans` driver). **Issue encountered**: several `lavra-review`-wave agents initially returned meta-responses saying they'd "dispatched a background agent" instead of performing the review themselves, requiring an explicit "do this yourself, do not delegate" retry instruction before real findings came through — this recursive-delegation behavior was not expected and cost extra round-trips.
- **Bash/git/cargo**: extensive use of `cargo build`/`test`/`fmt`/`clippy`, `cargo xtask check-version-sync`, `git` (worktree, commit, push), `gh` (PR create/view/checks), `bd` (bead show/create/comments).
- **MCP/other**: none beyond the above for this portion of the session.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `bash .../worktree-new.sh feature/shell-agent-cli-rename` | Created `.worktrees/feature-shell-agent-cli-rename`; sync script path resolution failed once, ran `worktree-sync.sh` directly afterward — succeeded, `--check` reported no parity gaps |
| `gh pr create --draft ...` | Created PR #123 |
| `cargo build --lib --bin cortex` (repeated) | Clean throughout |
| `cargo test --lib` (repeated) | 1864 → 1865 → 1868 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored, across the review-fix commits |
| `cargo test --bin cortex` | 511 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored |
| `cargo fmt --check` | Clean (one violation caught and fixed with `cargo fmt` after adding `main_tests.rs` tests) |
| `RUSTC_WRAPPER='' cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` (repeated) | Clean throughout |
| `cargo xtask check-version-sync` | `OK: 8 version-bearing file(s) in sync at 3.7.0` |
| `git push` (×3) | All succeeded; pre-push hooks (version-sync, module-size, clippy) all green |
| `gh pr checks 123` | CI running at session-log time (Changes/Clippy/Tests/Formatting/Version Sync pending; Secret Scan, GitGuardian, CodeRabbit-skip already passed) |

## Errors Encountered

- Mistakenly launched the first implementation-agent dispatch with `isolation: "worktree"`, which would have created a second, unrelated auto-isolated worktree instead of using the already-prepared one with the pushed branch and open PR. Caught immediately, stopped the agent via `TaskStop` before it did any work, confirmed no stray worktree was created, and relaunched without `isolation` (the agent's own explicit `cd` into the correct path was sufficient).
- `bd create --tags ...` failed with "unknown flag: --tags" — the correct flag is `--labels`. Retried successfully.
- Several `lavra-review` agents returned meta-delegation responses instead of findings (see Tools and Skills Used) — resolved by retrying with explicit "do this yourself" instructions.
- The rewritten `main.rs` guard block introduced a `cargo fmt` violation (multi-line `assert!` not reformatted) — caught by `cargo fmt --check`, fixed with `cargo fmt`.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| CLI grammar | `cortex ingest agent-command ingest-spool`/`wrap`, `cortex setup agent-command ...` | `cortex ingest shell user {index,atuin-index}` / `cortex ingest shell agent {index,wrap}`, `cortex setup shell {agent,completions} ...`; old grouped grammar still accepted as a deprecated alias |
| Agent-command spool handling | Local-DB-only; `--http`/`--server`/`--token` explicitly rejected | `ingest shell agent index --server URL --token TOKEN` forwards to a remote Cortex's new `POST /v1/agent-commands` endpoint instead of writing locally; `--token` without `--server` now errors instead of being silently discarded |
| `cortex doctor` | No systemd-unit awareness | `cortex doctor --fix --yes` detects (and can disable) systemd `--user` units whose `ExecStart=` still invokes the old grammar |
| Shell completions | `cortex completions <shell>` prints script to stdout only, no install automation | `cortex setup shell completions install\|remove\|check` automates installing that same script to disk |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo build --lib --bin cortex` | clean | clean | pass |
| `cargo test --lib` | all pass | 1868 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored | pass |
| `cargo test --bin cortex` | all pass | 511 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored | pass |
| `cargo fmt --check` | clean | clean (after one fix) | pass |
| `RUSTC_WRAPPER='' cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` | clean | clean | pass |
| `cargo xtask check-version-sync` | in sync | 8 files in sync at 3.7.0 | pass |
| `gh pr checks 123` | green | pending at session-log time (just pushed) | pending |

## Risks and Rollback

- CI on the final push (`afe34c9`) was still pending when this log was written — the branch's own pre-push hooks (version-sync, module-size, clippy) already passed locally, but full CI (Tests, Formatting, Dependency Check, Pre-publish gate) had not yet reported.
- Rollback: PR #123 is a single feature branch off `main`; reverting is `git branch -D feature/shell-agent-cli-rename` locally / closing the PR remotely with no impact on `main`, since nothing has merged yet.
- Operational risk called out explicitly in the plan and PR body: any host with an already-installed wrapper or manually-created timer (confirmed: `dookie` has one) needs `cortex setup shell agent install` to regenerate the wrapper after this ships, and `cortex doctor --fix --yes` (or manual review) to retire the stale timer — this is the actual production fix for bead `syslog-mcp-4n4a6`, not yet performed live.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not build a single enum-returning argv classifier (`type-design-analyzer`'s "best design-quality win for the effort" suggestion) — deferred as optional follow-up polish since the plain-function extraction already resolves the drift risk the review flagged.
- Did not fix the 3 pre-existing findings (`validate_agent_command_binary` blocking call, `entry_exists` dedup race, merge-test coverage gap) in this PR — filed as standalone backlog beads per `lavra-review`'s pre-existing-vs-introduced classification rule, since none predate or are introduced by this PR's own changes.
- Did not attempt a second full 5-agent PR Review Toolkit wave after the fix commit — judged diminishing returns given 11 total review agents already ran across both waves and the fixes were small, mechanical, and independently verified green.

## Open Questions

- Whether `docs/superpowers/plans/` should get a `complete/` archive convention mirroring `docs/plans/complete/` — not resolved, left as a repository-maintenance observation only.
- CI status on commit `afe34c9` was still pending at the time this log was written; final CI outcome should be checked before merging PR #123.

## Next Steps

- Wait for CI to go green on PR #123, then run the `vibin:merge-status` final gate before publishing as complete.
- Once merged, deploy and run `cortex setup shell agent install` + `cortex doctor --fix --yes` (or manual review) on `dookie` to actually resolve the live incident bead `syslog-mcp-4n4a6` describes, then close it.
- Triage the 3 backlog beads (`syslog-mcp-7j61f`, `syslog-mcp-q6a2j`, `syslog-mcp-uail9`) in a future session — none are urgent.
- Consider the optional enum-based argv-classifier refactor and the `MAX_RECORDS_PER_BATCH`-enforced-in-the-domain-function (rather than only the HTTP handler) suggestion from `type-design-analyzer` as low-priority follow-up polish.
