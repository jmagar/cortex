# PR #51 Log Filter Surface Merge Session

## User Request

The session focused on turning the brainstormed log filtering capability into a contract-first implementation, then handling PR review feedback, merging PR #51, pulling latest `main`, cleaning up the feature branch/worktree, and saving the session to markdown.

## Session Overview

PR #51, "feat: add structured log filter surface", was implemented, reviewed, fixed, verified, merged into `main`, and cleaned up. The final merge commit is `c94b5a64d7b60156f434f6a7425b1eafc4ffaa99`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Drafted the first-class log filter contract before implementation.
2. Implemented the reusable filter model across DB, service, REST, MCP, CLI, docs, smoke tests, and version metadata.
3. Addressed PR review feedback for conflicting source aliases and transcript-only source filtering.
4. Added REST `/api/filter` regression tests after Lavra review identified route-level residual risk.
5. Verified locally and through GitHub CI, merged PR #51, pulled latest `main`, removed the feature worktree, and deleted local and remote feature branches.

## Key Findings

- `source_kind=transcript` needed to filter actual transcript rows, not only AI metadata; agent-command rows can share `ai_project` and `ai_session_id`.
- Existing `source_ip_prefix` filtering was sufficient for transcript discrimination via `transcript://`.
- REST `/api/filter` needed explicit route-level tests in addition to service-layer tests.
- PR #51 was mergeable and all GitHub checks passed before merge.
- The root `main` worktree had pre-existing uncommitted changes before pull; they were preserved in `stash@{0}: pre-pr51-main-local-dirty-before-pull-20260525`.

## Technical Decisions

- Kept filtering structured-only: `/api/filter` rejects free-text `query` parameters and the CLI `filter` command rejects query terms.
- Used `source_ip`/`source_ip_prefix` as the synthetic source discriminator instead of adding a schema migration.
- Treated source aliases such as `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` as tool aliases, while rejecting conflicts with explicit `tool=...`.
- Added focused regression coverage rather than broad refactors during PR review cleanup.
- Used a squash merge through GitHub, preserving the feature branch history in the PR while landing a single `main` commit.

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: inspected `docs/plans` and `docs/superpowers/plans`; no older plan file was moved because completion state was not proven from current evidence. The PR-created plan remains at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-first-class-log-filter-surface.md`.
- Beads: inspected relevant issue `syslog-mcp-9d07`; `bd dolt push` completed after review work, and `bd dolt pull` completed after merge cleanup.
- Worktrees: `git worktree list --porcelain` now shows only `/home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp` on `main`.
- Branches: removed `.worktrees/log-filter-surface`, deleted local branch `feat/log-filter-surface`, and deleted remote branch `origin/feat/log-filter-surface`.
- Stale docs: PR #51 updated the filter contract, README, API docs, MCP docs, skill docs, smoke tests, changelog, and version metadata. No additional stale-doc update was made during save closeout.
- Preserved local work: root `main` had pre-existing uncommitted changes before pull; they were saved as `stash@{0}: pre-pr51-main-local-dirty-before-pull-20260525`.

## Tools and Skills Used

- `save-to-md` skill: used for this session capture.
- `gh-pr` skill and helper scripts: fetched PR comments, verified resolution, replied to and resolved review threads.
- Lavra skills: used `lavra-plan`, `lavra-research`, `agent-native-architecture` as design review, `lavra-eng-review`, `lavra-work-single`, and `lavra-review`.
- GitHub CLI: checked PR metadata, mergeability, status checks, merge result, and branch cleanup.
- Git: inspected status, diffs, worktrees, branches, stash state, pushed commits, merged PR, pulled `main`, and deleted branches.
- Cargo and repo scripts: ran targeted tests, full tests, formatting, clippy, version sync, and pre-push hooks.
- Beads CLI: read, commented, claimed, closed, pushed, and pulled tracker state.
- Shell tools: used `sed`, `find`, `tail`, and standard shell commands for evidence gathering.

## Errors Encountered

- Gemini headless assessment previously emitted an unexpected `write_file` tool call in assessment mode. That prompted a review/fix flow before this PR #51 work.
- `gh pr merge 51 --squash --delete-branch` returned `fatal: 'main' is already used by worktree at '/home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp'`, but the PR had already merged on GitHub. Local cleanup continued from the root `main` worktree.
- `bd dolt push` completed but printed `Warning: auto-export: git add failed: exit status 128`; subsequent `git status` showed no worktree dirt from that warning.
- The root `main` checkout was dirty before pulling. It was stashed instead of overwritten.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

- Before: users could search logs but did not have a structured-only filter surface across CLI, REST, MCP, and DB.
- After: `filter` is available as a structured filter action with host/app/source/severity/time/tool/project/session-style filters.
- Before: `source_kind=transcript` could over-return non-transcript rows when metadata overlapped.
- After: `source_kind=transcript` maps to `source_ip_prefix="transcript://"` and excludes `agent-command://...` rows.
- Before: REST route coverage for `/api/filter` did not cover query rejection or transcript source discrimination.
- After: route-level regressions cover both cases.

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo test filter_route_rejects_query_param -- --nocapture` | `/api/filter?query=...` rejected | test passed | pass |
| `cargo test filter_route_transcript_source_kind_excludes_agent_commands -- --nocapture` | transcript filter excludes agent-command rows | test passed | pass |
| `cargo test filter_route -- --nocapture` | route filter tests pass | passed | pass |
| `cargo fmt --check` | formatting clean | passed | pass |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` | no clippy warnings | passed | pass |
| `bash scripts/check-version-sync.sh` | version files aligned | all 4 files at `v0.32.6` | pass |
| pre-push `cargo test` | full suite passes | hook summary passed in 35.28s | pass |
| `verify_resolution.py --input /tmp/syslog-mcp-pr51-final.json` | all review threads addressed | `2 thread(s) resolved or outdated` | pass |
| `gh pr view 51 --json statusCheckRollup` | all checks successful | CI, docker, CodeRabbit, and GitGuardian checks successful | pass |
| `git status --short --branch` after cleanup | clean `main` at origin | `## main...origin/main` before this session note was written | pass |
| `git worktree list --porcelain` after cleanup | only root worktree remains | only `/home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp` listed | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: structured filter semantics touch DB query construction, service aliases, REST, MCP, and CLI paths. Mitigation: targeted DB/service/API/CLI tests, full pre-push tests, clippy, version sync, PR review, and GitHub CI all passed.
- Risk: preserved root-worktree stash contains pre-existing local changes that may need manual replay. Mitigation: stash name records why it exists.
- Rollback: revert merge commit `c94b5a64d7b60156f434f6a7425b1eafc4ffaa99` if PR #51 needs to be backed out.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not implement mesh heartbeat behavior for v1; the earlier heartbeat discussion deferred mesh.
- Did not add a new database column for transcript source type; existing `source_ip_prefix` was sufficient.
- Did not move older plan files because their completion state was ambiguous from current evidence.
- Did not apply the preserved stash back onto `main`; it predates the pull and was outside the PR #51 cleanup request.

## References

- PR #51: https://github.com/jmagar/syslog-mcp/pull/51
- Merge commit: `c94b5a64d7b60156f434f6a7425b1eafc4ffaa99`
- Review bead: `syslog-mcp-9d07`
- Contract: `docs/contracts/log-filter-surface.md`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-first-class-log-filter-surface.md`

## Open Questions

- Whether to replay or inspect `stash@{0}: pre-pr51-main-local-dirty-before-pull-20260525`.
- Whether older plan files under `docs/plans` and `docs/superpowers/plans` should be audited and moved to a completed archive in a separate cleanup pass.

## Next Steps

- Inspect the preserved stash before starting unrelated `main` work: `git stash show --stat stash@{0}`.
- If the stash is still needed, apply it on a dedicated branch or worktree rather than directly onto clean `main`.
- For future filter work, exercise the live CLI/REST/MCP surfaces against production-like log data after deployment.
