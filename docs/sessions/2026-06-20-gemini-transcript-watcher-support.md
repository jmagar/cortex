# Cortex Gemini transcript watcher support

## User Request
Investigate the Cortex issues around squirts transcript permission storms, Docker socket oddness, remote Docker capability checks, schema/help drift, `usage_blocks`, and noisy `unaddressed_errors`; then work `syslog-mcp-cpeie` and `syslog-mcp-fs2k6` through Lavra and save the session.

## Session Overview
Cortex investigation and remediation closed three beads. The review-finding work shipped topic/correlate schema fixes, `usage_blocks` limit support, remote Docker event unsupported-host observability, and warning-noise filtering. The live squirts transcript storm was fixed by replacing the stale rsyslog imfile tail with the supported user-level Cortex AI watcher. The final work added first-class Gemini transcript ingestion to the watcher and scanner, including whole-file Gemini chat parsing, `.gemini/tmp` root support, setup/doctor coverage, docs, tests, and a version bump to `1.33.0`.

## Sequence of Events
1. Investigated live Cortex issues from June 19/20 logs and closed `syslog-mcp-6g5bt` with code fixes in commit `1a225af`.
2. Worked `syslog-mcp-cpeie` on squirts by disabling the stale rsyslog transcript tail and verifying the supported `cortex-ai-watch.service` indexed Claude/Codex sessions without post-restart permission errors.
3. Created/followed `syslog-mcp-fs2k6` because the retired rsyslog drop-in had also tailed Gemini chat JSON files.
4. Added `SourceKind::GeminiSession`, `.gemini/tmp` default root support, whole-file Gemini JSON parsing, and watcher setup/doctor support in commit `1fb9afc`.
5. Ran focused and full verification, handled review/self-review findings, closed the bead, pushed Beads, and pushed branch `codex/fix-cortex-review-findings`.
6. Ran the `save-to-md` maintenance pass and wrote this session artifact as a path-limited docs commit.

## Key Findings
- Live squirts rsyslog was reading `/home/jmagar/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` as `rsyslog`, but those transcript files are owned by the user and mode `600`; `syslog-mcp-cpeie` records the replacement with the host-local watcher.
- Gemini chat transcripts are whole-file JSON at `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json`, not JSONL; the parser therefore uses a file-level path in `src/scanner/gemini.rs:18`.
- Gemini files may have `projectHash` without a cwd/project path; the parser stores that as `gemini://project/<hash>` so AI session inventory queries can see it (`src/scanner/gemini.rs:30`).
- The scanner model now includes `gemini_root` in doctor output and `GeminiSession` in source-kind handling (`src/scanner.rs:127`, `src/scanner.rs:174`).
- The watcher systemd unit now bind-mounts `.gemini/tmp` read-only and checks that root along with Claude/Codex (`src/setup/ai_watch.rs:268`, `src/setup/ai_watch.rs:287`).
- User-facing docs now describe Claude/Codex/Gemini roots, Gemini `session-*.json`, and the `gemini://project/<hash>` fallback (`README.md:503`, `docs/CLI.md:353`).

## Technical Decisions
- Implemented Gemini support rather than documenting non-support because the old squirts rsyslog drop-in had been tailing Gemini chats and the maintained replacement needed equivalent coverage.
- Parsed Gemini chat files as whole-file JSON because the observed sample had top-level session metadata plus a `messages[]` array.
- Used `projectHash` as a stable synthetic project only when no cwd/project path exists, preserving queryability without inventing a filesystem path.
- Kept the watcher host-local; Docker Compose still owns only the server/query runtime, while transcript roots remain user-home paths.
- Ran Lavra review despite degraded subagent results; two review agents hit usage limits, the simplicity reviewer returned no findings, and self-review caught and fixed the Gemini project fallback issue.

## Beads Activity
| bead | title | action(s) | final status | why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `syslog-mcp-6g5bt` | Investigate Cortex log ingestion and correlation papercuts | Worked and closed | closed | Tracked the original Cortex issue bundle: schema/help drift, `usage_blocks`, remote Docker capability checks, and warning-noise filtering. |
| `syslog-mcp-cpeie` | Fix squirts transcript tailing permissions | Worked and closed | closed | Replaced the stale rsyslog transcript tail with user-level `cortex-ai-watch.service` on squirts and verified no post-restart permission storm. |
| `syslog-mcp-fs2k6` | Add Gemini transcript support to Cortex AI watcher | Claimed, commented, worked, closed | closed | Added first-class Gemini watcher/indexer support so the supported replacement covers what the old rsyslog drop-in had tailed. |

## Repository Maintenance
- **Plans**: `docs/plans/` contains three non-complete plan files and two files under `docs/plans/complete/`; none were clearly completed by this session, so no plan files were moved.
- **Beads**: verified and closed `syslog-mcp-fs2k6`; `syslog-mcp-6g5bt` and `syslog-mcp-cpeie` were already observed closed with relevant close reasons. `bd dolt push` completed successfully after closing `syslog-mcp-fs2k6`.
- **Worktrees and branches**: `git worktree list --porcelain` showed only `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex`; local branches were `main` and `codex/fix-cortex-review-findings`, with matching remote tracking branches. No branch or worktree cleanup was safe or needed.
- **Stale docs**: README and CLI docs contradicted the new Gemini support until updated in `1fb9afc`; no additional stale docs were found during this pass.
- **Skipped/left alone**: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-20-graph-investigation-workspace.md` remained untracked and unrelated to this bead/session artifact commit.
- **Transcript note**: the injected transcript path existed and was sampled, but its tail reflected an older June 18 Claude session; current session facts were grounded in git, Beads, command output, and this conversation context.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Skills**: `lavra:lavra-work`, `lavra:lavra-work-single`, `lavra:lavra-review`, `beads:beads`, `vibin:save-to-md`, and `superpowers:using-superpowers`.
- **Subagents**: Lavra review spawned code-review/security/simplicity agents; two returned usage-limit errors and one completed with no findings.
- **Shell/Git/Cargo**: used for git status, commits, push, version bump, Rust tests, clippy, and release sync checks.
- **Beads CLI**: claimed/commented/closed work and pushed Dolt state.
- **Lumen MCP**: used for code discovery before line-reference reads for the session artifact.
- **Cortex/Labby context**: prior live investigation used Cortex tooling and Labby-style MCP access to inspect logs and correlate live host behavior; the final Gemini implementation was verified locally through the Rust test suite.
- **External CLIs**: `gh pr view` identified PR `#90`; `cargo xtask` handled version sync.

| `RUSTC_WRAPPER='' cargo clippy --config 'build.rustc-wrapper=""' --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | passed |
| `git commit -m "feat(syslog-mcp-fs2k6): add Gemini transcript watcher support"` | committed `1fb9afc`; pre-commit checks passed |
| `bd close syslog-mcp-fs2k6 --reason ...` | closed bead |
| `bd dolt push` | pushed Beads state |
| `git push` | pre-push `cargo test --all-targets --all-features` passed in about 406 seconds; branch pushed `1a225af..1fb9afc` |

## Errors Encountered
- Initial full `cargo test --all-targets` run failed three tests: one timing-sensitive writer-permit test and two fixtures missing the new Gemini root. The fixture issues were patched, the writer test passed on focused rerun, and the final full suite passed.
- Lavra review subagents degraded: code-review and security agents hit usage limits; the simplicity reviewer returned no actionable findings. Self-review caught the queryability issue and fixed it with the `gemini://project/<hash>` fallback.
- During `git push`, the pre-push hook was quiet long enough to look suspicious; process inspection showed it was running `cargo test --all-targets --all-features`, and it eventually passed.
- The injected Claude transcript path existed but belonged to an older June 18 session tail, so it was not treated as the authoritative source for this June 20 Codex work.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)
| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Squirts transcript ingestion | rsyslog tried to read user-owned Claude transcript JSONL files and hit permission storms | supported user-level Cortex AI watcher handles transcript ingestion |
| Gemini transcripts | old rsyslog drop-in tailed Gemini chat files, but supported watcher indexed Claude/Codex only | watcher/scanner supports `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json` |
| AI session inventory | Gemini files with only `projectHash` would have no project and be invisible to project inventory filters | Gemini fallback project is `gemini://project/<hash>` |
| Remote Docker events on unsupported hosts | hosts without Docker could continue noisy/opaque retry behavior | unsupported remote Docker events are surfaced as warning/counter state |
| MCP/schema ergonomics | schema/help drift existed around topic/correlate and `usage_blocks limit` | review-finding commit aligned schema/runtime behavior |
| Unaddressed warning noise | health/probe warning noise could dominate signatures | warning-noise filtering/paging behavior is narrower and more useful |

## Verification Evidence
| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo xtask check-version-sync` | version files agree | `OK: 8 version-bearing file(s) in sync at 1.33.0` | pass |
| `cargo xtask check-release-versions` | release files agree | `OK: 8 version-bearing file(s) in sync at 1.33.0` | pass |
| `cargo test --all-targets` | all tests pass | lib `1499 passed`; main `456 passed`; integration targets passed | pass |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | no warnings/errors | finished successfully | pass |
| pre-push `cargo test --all-targets --all-features` | all feature-gated tests pass before push | hook passed and branch pushed | pass |
| `bd show syslog-mcp-fs2k6` | bead closed | status `CLOSED`; close reason records Gemini support | pass |
| `git status --short --branch` | branch synced, no related dirty files | branch matched origin; only unrelated untracked superpowers plan remained | pass |

## Risks and Rollback
- The Gemini parser accepts observed Gemini chat shapes and a line parser fallback, but future Gemini format changes may require parser expansion. Rollback path: revert commit `1fb9afc` and redeploy the previous version.
- The synthetic `gemini://project/<hash>` project keeps sessions queryable but is not a filesystem path. Consumers that assume `ai_project` is always a path should treat this URI as an opaque project identifier.
- The branch contains both review-finding fixes and Gemini support. A narrow rollback can revert `1fb9afc`; a broader rollback would revert both `1fb9afc` and `1a225af`.

## Decisions Not Taken
- Did not restore rsyslog access to transcript files via ACLs/groups; the supported user-level Cortex watcher is a better match for private user transcript roots.
- Did not document Gemini as unsupported; live squirts evidence showed the old tail path had been trying to ingest Gemini chats.
- Did not move old `docs/plans/*` files to `complete/`; none were clearly completed by this session.
- Did not stage or modify `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-20-graph-investigation-workspace.md`; it was unrelated and pre-existing in the worktree.

## Open Questions
- Whether any consumer of `ai_project` assumes it is always a filesystem path; Gemini now intentionally uses `gemini://project/<hash>` when only `projectHash` is available.
- Whether PR #90 should be merged as-is or split if the review-finding fixes and Gemini support need separate review boundaries.
- The unrelated untracked superpowers plan file remains in the worktree and needs an owner decision outside this session log.

## Next Steps
1. Review and merge PR #90 when ready.
2. Deploy Cortex `1.33.0` where Gemini transcript indexing is desired.
3. On hosts with Gemini activity, run or check `cortex setup ai-watch-service install/check` so `.gemini/tmp` is mounted and watched.
4. Decide what to do with `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-20-graph-investigation-workspace.md`.
