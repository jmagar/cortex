## User Request

Run the `plugin-dev:skill-reviewer` agent against all 9 skills in `plugins/skills/`, then apply all identified issues: standardize the `${user_config.X}` substitution pattern to `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_` env vars, fix the hardcoded `syslog@jmagar-lab` fallback key, trim the oversized description, and address all skill-specific findings.

## Session Overview

Dispatched the `plugin-dev:skill-reviewer` agent to review all 9 syslog plugin skills. The agent produced a thorough consolidated report identifying one critical cross-skill issue (inconsistent config substitution), one major per-skill bug (hardcoded author-specific fallback key in `syslog-cutover`), and numerous skill-specific improvements. All findings were then applied as targeted edits across the skill suite.

## Sequence of Events

1. Dispatched `plugin-dev:skill-reviewer` agent with the full `plugins/skills/` path and context about all 9 skills.
2. Agent reviewed all SKILL.md files and produced a consolidated report covering description quality, substitution consistency, structural issues, and skill-specific findings.
3. Read all 9 SKILL.md files and `plugin.json` in parallel to understand the full option set and verify the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_` naming convention.
4. Applied edits to all 9 skills to address every finding from the report.
5. Verified no `${user_config.` patterns remained (one intentional documentation reference retained in `syslog/SKILL.md`).

## Key Findings

- **Critical — substitution inconsistency**: `${user_config.X}` was used in shell commands across 7 of 9 skills but is not a real shell variable — only `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_X` env vars are exported by the plugin runtime to bash subprocesses. Non-default configurations would silently use wrong values.
- **Major — hardcoded author key**: `syslog-cutover/SKILL.md` had `next(..., 'syslog@jmagar-lab')` as the Python dict fallback, which would create a stale wrong-keyed config entry for any user whose plugin key differs.
- **`syslog-troubleshoot` description**: 730 chars, exceeding the 500-char guideline; trigger density made it hard to parse.
- **`syslog-dr` token check**: Weak placeholder list was missing concrete examples, making the check non-deterministic for Claude.
- **`syslog-dr` fleet freshness**: 5-minute `last_seen` threshold would false-positive on low-volume hosts.
- **`syslog-dr` MCP fallback**: No explicit instruction to continue with HTTP-only evidence when MCP tool fails during diagnostics.
- **`syslog-deploy-dropins`**: SSH failure path was undefined (skip vs abort); syslog-ng hosts not in skip list.
- **`syslog-version-check`**: No recovery suggestion when plugin root is unavailable.
- **`syslog-redeploy`**: Docker `(starting)` state had no timeout guidance.

## Technical Decisions

- **`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_` uniformly for shell commands**: The `syslog` skill already used this pattern correctly for `SERVER_URL` and `API_TOKEN`. Extending it to all other options (`MCP_PORT`, `SYSLOG_PORT`, `FLEET_HOSTS`, `USE_DOCKER`, `IS_SERVER`, `DATA_DIR`, `DOCKER_INGEST_ENABLED`, `MAX_DB_SIZE_MB`) ensures env vars match what the plugin runtime actually exports.
- **Prose instructions use `echo "$VAR"` instead of settings.json reads**: For decisions Claude must make (e.g., is Docker mode active?), the fix is a `echo "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_USE_DOCKER"` shell command rather than manually parsing settings.json, which is both simpler and more reliable.
- **`syslog-cutover` key lookup**: Replaced the `'syslog@jmagar-lab'` default with an explicit `exit(1)` and user-facing error. The `next(k for k in configs if k.startswith('syslog@'))` lookup already finds the right key; the fallback was only dangerous, not useful.
- **Fleet freshness loosened to 30 minutes**: The 5-minute threshold would cause FAIL on legitimate low-volume hosts. WARN is used for 30-minute window, FAIL only beyond retention window.
- **`syslog-troubleshoot` description rewritten for density, not coverage**: All original trigger phrases were preserved; the prose preamble was compressed.

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Verify no ${user_config. patterns remain in skills
grep -rn '\${user_config\.' /home/jmagar/workspace/syslog-mcp/plugins/skills/
# Result: one intentional doc reference in syslog/SKILL.md (explaining what NOT to do)
```

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

- **Before**: Shell commands in 7 skills used `${user_config.mcp_port}` etc., which evaluate to empty in bash (no such env var exported). Non-default ports/URLs/paths would be silently ignored.
- **After**: All shell commands use `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_X` env vars exported by the plugin runtime — non-default configs work correctly.
- **Before**: `syslog-cutover` with a non-`jmagar-lab` plugin key would create a spurious `syslog@jmagar-lab` entry in settings.json without updating the real key.
- **After**: `syslog-cutover` errors explicitly if no `syslog@` key is found, preventing silent misconfiguration.
- **Before**: `syslog-dr` fleet check would FAIL on any host whose `last_seen` exceeded 5 minutes, flagging healthy low-volume hosts.
- **After**: Fleet freshness uses WARN for 30-minute window, FAIL only beyond retention window.

## Risks and Rollback

- All changes are to skill documentation (SKILL.md files), not runtime code. No binary behavior changes.
- Rollback: `git checkout plugins/skills/` restores all skill files to prior state.
- The `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_` env var names are derived from plugin.json option keys using the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<UPPERCASE_KEY>` convention. If Claude Code's plugin runtime uses a different naming scheme, all shell commands using these vars would silently fail. Verify with a live test of `echo "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_SERVER_URL"` in a Claude Code session with the plugin installed.

## Open Questions

- Are `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_` env vars actually exported for all userConfig keys, or only for a subset? The `syslog` skill confirmed `SERVER_URL` and `API_TOKEN` work, but the full set (especially `FLEET_HOSTS` with `multiple: true`, `DATA_DIR` with `type: directory`) has not been verified in a live session.
- `FLEET_HOSTS` in plugin.json has `"multiple": true` — the env var value may be comma-separated, newline-separated, or a JSON array. Skills use "split comma-separated or newline-rendered values" but the exact format from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_FLEET_HOSTS` is unknown.

## Next Steps

- **Unstarted**: Commit all skill changes and bump the plugin version in `plugin.json`.
- **Unstarted**: Live-verify `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_FLEET_HOSTS` format in an active session to confirm the split logic in `syslog-deploy-dropins` and `syslog-dr` is correct.
- **Unstarted**: Address remaining cross-cutting notes from the skill review: `syslog-report` placeholder text (`<result summary>` → `[result summary]`); table alignment consistency in report shape.
