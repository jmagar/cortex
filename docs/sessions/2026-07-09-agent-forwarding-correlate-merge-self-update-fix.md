# Agent forwarding, correlate/ask_history merge, and self-update root-cause fix

## User Request

Started as a release-binary build/sync task, then expanded through several explicit follow-ups: merge `ask_history` into `correlate` (query-derived `reference_time`) since it was "really just a simpler version of correlate"; make the cortex agent forward *everything* not already flowing through it (AI transcripts, shell history, agent commands); verify the fleet is running the latest agent; and, most pointedly, verify (not assume) that the agent self-update mechanism actually works: "did you fix it so that its actually going to auto update all of the devices."

## Session Overview

Merged the `ask_history` MCP action into `correlate` (query-derived `reference_time`) and removed `ask_history` entirely. Built three new agent-side forwarding streams — AI transcripts (Claude/Codex/Gemini), shell history (zsh/atuin), and agent-run commands — each with a server-side HTTP ingest endpoint, found and fixed real bugs in each (checkpoint over-advance, missing batch cap causing 413s, non-UTF-8 hard-error, missing credential scrubbing). Rolled the resulting binary/image out across the full fleet (dookie, squirts, steamy-wsl, vivobook-wsl, tootie, shart, and — newly — agent-os on Windows). Root-caused a self-update failure that had been silently unexplained for hours, fixed the underlying diagnostic gap (truncated `anyhow` error logging) fleet-wide, and added a guard against the specific dev-loop collision that caused it. Along the way, found and fixed three unrelated pre-existing stale-test/registry bugs from an earlier commit (`d705740`) that added a `cortex status` CLI command but never fully wired it into the surfaces registry, the CLI-vs-MCP routing test, or the help catalog. Closed out three beads that this work resolved.

## Sequence of Events

1. Investigated cortex's actual deployment host, corrected stale docs/memory claiming it ran on dookie (it runs on tootie; dookie is the dev checkout).
2. Audited cortex plugin skills for quality/accuracy.
3. Redesigned `correlate`/`ask_history`: made `reference_time` optional on `CorrelateEventsRequest`, added query-derived lookup via `db::search_ai_sessions`, removed `ask_history` action/route/docs entirely per explicit user confirmation ("Remove it entirely").
4. User asked what else isn't flowing through the agent; identified AI transcripts, shell history, and agent commands as gaps.
5. Built `/v1/ai-transcripts` ingest endpoint and an agent-side poller supporting both line-based (Claude/Codex) and whole-file (Gemini, record-index checkpoint) sources.
6. Built `/v1/shell-history` ingest endpoint and an agent-side poller for zsh extended-history and atuin sqlite.
7. Fixed agent-command spool forwarding to chunk large backlogs instead of sending one oversized POST (was hitting Cloudflare's 413 limit).
8. Hit and recovered from a `git stash` mishap: a chained `stash && cargo test ; stash pop` was killed mid-test by the Bash tool's 2-minute timeout, silently reverting all tracked changes for an unknown window during which several rebuild/redeploy cycles ran against pre-session code. Recovered via `git stash pop` (stash was never dropped) and re-verified everything from that point on via binary-content `grep`, not version strings.
9. Rolled the fixed binary out to dookie, squirts, steamy-wsl, tootie's and shart's Docker agent containers, verifying binary content and clean logs at each step; found and fixed a Docker-socket group-permission gap on tootie's recreated container (`--group-add 281`) and a systemd sandbox `ReadWritePaths` gap on steamy-wsl.
10. User asked directly whether self-update was actually verified to work fleet-wide. Investigated `src/agent/self_update.rs` end-to-end, found no existing test exercised `maybe_update()`'s full flow, and found the failure log format (`error = %error` on an `anyhow::Error`) only ever printed the outermost context, hiding the true OS error.
11. Reproduced the actual root cause standalone: a running process's own executable path being rewritten (as dookie's custom `cargo-rustc-wrapper` does on every `cargo build --release`, deploying straight to `~/.local/bin/cortex`) causes `current_exe()` to resolve to a `(deleted)` path that no longer exists, so every subsequent backup attempt fails with ENOENT, forever.
12. Fixed `self_update.rs` with an `ensure_binary_still_present()` fast-fail guard, added regression tests, and fixed the same truncated-logging pattern across `heartbeat_agent.rs`, `shell_history.rs`, `ai_transcript.rs`, and `command_log.rs`.
13. Rebuilt and redeployed across the entire fleet a second time with these fixes: dookie (systemd), squirts/steamy-wsl/vivobook-wsl (systemd binary copy), tootie/shart (Docker image `ghcr.io/jmagar/cortex:dev`), and newly set up agent-os (Windows Scheduled Task, cross-compiled binary, fixed a hostname-detection gap that made Windows agents report as `"unknown"`).
14. Fixed two self-inflicted regressions during the Docker recreation on tootie (needed `--network host`) and shart (needed `--user root` for a root-owned checkpoint file, and cleaned up an accidental duplicate container created by an errant `docker compose up`).
15. Ran the full `cargo test --release` suite, hit two failing tests unrelated to this session's diff, traced them to commit `d705740` (pre-session) having added a real `cortex status` CLI command without registering it in the surfaces registry or updating a stale CLI-routing test; fixed both plus a third related gap (missing help-catalog entry) discovered on the next full-suite rerun.
16. Committed and pushed (`9633617`, `c124114`); verified `git status` clean and up to date with `origin/main`.
17. Closed three beads whose described work this session completed: `syslog-mcp-69cmc` (AI-transcript forwarding), `syslog-mcp-34ghr` (shell-history forwarding), and `syslog-mcp-6smeb` (self-update failure — root-caused as a dev-loop-specific collision, not the originally-suspected systemd sandbox issue).

## Key Findings

- `src/agent/self_update.rs` (pre-session): `backup_current_binary()` failure path logged only the outer context via `tracing::warn!(error = %error, ...)`, never the underlying `io::Error` — the true cause of a self-update failure was unknowable from logs alone.
- Root cause of dookie's hours-long self-update failure: `.cargo/config.toml`'s `rustc-wrapper = "scripts/cargo-rustc-wrapper"` deploys every release build straight to `~/.local/bin/cortex`, the exact path the already-running agent was exec'd from. On Linux, `std::env::current_exe()` resolves through `/proc/self/exe`; once that path is rewritten, it resolves to `<path> (deleted)`, and any `hard_link`/`copy` against it fails with ENOENT forever. Reproduced standalone with a minimal repro (`rustc` scratch program + concurrent `rename`).
- Direct evidence the mechanism works correctly on real (non-dev-loop) hosts: shart's production Docker container was observed self-updating live from 3.8.0 to 3.8.1 during this session (`agent update confirmed healthy version=3.8.1` in its logs).
- `src/agent/shell_history.rs:103-136` (`read_new_zsh_lines`): originally used `BufRead::lines()`, which hard-errors the entire read on the first non-UTF-8 byte — confirmed live on dookie's real `.zsh_history`. Fixed via raw `read_until` + `from_utf8_lossy`.
- `src/agent/ai_transcript.rs`: checkpoint tracking originally returned the file's true EOF line count even when a batch limit cut the read short, silently and permanently skipping content past the limit on every subsequent cycle.
- `src/command_log.rs`: agent-command spool forwarding sent the entire backlog (41MB/46K lines observed) in one unchunked POST, triggering Cloudflare 413s; fixed with a bounded per-chunk read/consume loop.
- `src/surfaces.rs`, `src/main_tests.rs`, `src/cli/help.rs`: commit `d705740` (2026-07-08, pre-session) added a real local-mode `cortex status` CLI command but left it out of the CLI surfaces registry, left a stale test asserting `status` should be rejected as unknown, and never added it to the help catalog — three latent test failures that only surfaced once `cargo test --release` was run to completion this session.
- Windows-specific: `heartbeat_agent.rs:1534` `hostname()` only checks the `$HOSTNAME` env var and `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`, both meaningless on Windows, so the agent-os agent reported as hostname `"unknown"` until `$env:HOSTNAME` was set explicitly in its launch wrapper.

## Technical Decisions

- Removed `ask_history` entirely rather than keeping it as a deprecated alias, per explicit user instruction, since its capability is a strict subset of `correlate`'s query-derived mode.
- Fixed the self-update root cause at the diagnostic layer (`ensure_binary_still_present()` guard + full `anyhow` error-chain logging) rather than trying to prevent the dev-loop collision itself, since the collision is an inherent property of dookie's fast-iteration build wrapper and isn't reproducible on real fleet hosts.
- Fixed the three pre-existing stale-test/registry gaps in-session (rather than filing new beads and moving on) since they were small, clearly-scoped, and blocked a clean `cargo test --release` run that was itself required before this session's changes could be safely committed.
- Chose `--group-add 281` (tootie) and `--user root` (shart) as the minimal fix for each Docker permission gap rather than changing the images' default UID, since both are host-specific bind-mount ownership quirks.
- Used `$env:HOSTNAME` in agent-os's PowerShell launch wrapper instead of patching `heartbeat_agent.rs`'s cross-platform hostname detection, since it's a one-host Windows deployment quirk, not a general portability gap worth complicating the core binary for.

## Beads Activity

- `syslog-mcp-69cmc` — "Agent-forwarded AI transcript ingestion (dookie->tootie)" (P1, feature): updated with implementation notes (endpoint, poller, bugs found/fixed, live verification evidence) and **closed**. This bead precisely described the gap this session's AI-transcript forwarder fills.
- `syslog-mcp-34ghr` — "Forward zsh/bash/atuin shell history to central cortex server" (P2, feature): updated with implementation notes and **closed**. Matches the shell-history forwarder built this session, including the scrub-coverage check the bead explicitly called for.
- `syslog-mcp-6smeb` — "host heartbeat-agent self-update fails error=write (stuck on 1.30.0)" (P2, bug, filed 2026-06-19): updated with the confirmed root cause (dev-loop exe-collision, not the originally-suspected systemd sandbox issue), the fixes applied, and live evidence that production self-update works, then **closed** with a note to reopen if the original write-staged-tmp symptom recurs on a non-dev host now that full error-chain logging would surface the real cause.

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: `docs/plans/` contains three active plans (`2026-03-29-unifi-cef-hostname-fix.md`, `2026-05-04-rmcp-stdio-support-follow-up.md`, `2026-05-11-mnemo-feature-port.md`) and a `complete/` directory with two already-archived plans. None relate to this session's work; none moved. Left as-is.
- **Beads**: three directly-relevant open beads found via `bd search` and closed with implementation notes (see Beads Activity). No other open beads matched this session's work (`ask_history`/`correlate` and agent-command forwarding had no corresponding beads — that work was done ad hoc per direct conversation request).
- **Worktrees/branches**: `git worktree list --porcelain` shows only the single main worktree; `git branch -vv` shows only `main`, tracking `origin/main` with no divergence. Remote has `origin/marketplace-no-mcp` and a release-please branch, both pre-existing and unrelated to this session; neither touched.
- **Stale docs**: updated inline as part of the correlate/ask_history merge commit (see Files Changed) — README/CLAUDE.md/docs/mcp/* etc. No separate stale-doc pass was needed beyond that.
- **Uncommitted pre-existing state**: `plugins/cortex/skills/redeploy/SKILL.md` and `plugins/cortex/skills/redeploy/agents/openai.yaml` were already deleted in the working tree at the start of this session (visible in the initial `git status` snapshot) and remain uncommitted. Left untouched per "never sweep unrelated drift into your commit" — flagged to the user, not resolved.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell (Bash)**: overwhelming majority of the session — `cargo build`/`test`/`clippy`, `git`, `ssh`/`scp` to six remote hosts, `docker build`/`push`/`run`/`exec`/`inspect`, `journalctl`, `systemctl --user`, `schtasks.exe`/`tasklist.exe` over SSH into a Windows box (worked around MSYS argv-mangling of `/`-prefixed flags with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`), `curl` against the production MCP endpoint. No failures beyond the two documented below.
- **Read/Edit/Write**: used throughout for all Rust source, docs, and the generated session artifact.
- **Monitor / ScheduleWakeup**: used repeatedly to wait on long-running background builds/tests (Windows cross-compile, Docker image build, multiple `cargo test --release` runs) without polling.
- **`bd` (beads) CLI**: used at session close to search for and close three relevant beads with implementation notes.
- **`vibin:save-to-md` skill**: this session-log generation itself.
- No subagents, browser tools, or other MCP servers were used this session.

## Commands Executed

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test --lib self_update` | 10/10 pass, including 2 new regression tests |
| `cargo clippy --lib` / `cargo clippy --release --all-targets` | clean both times |
| `cargo test --release` (final run) | 515 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored |
| `docker build -f config/Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/jmagar/cortex:dev .` then `docker push` | built and pushed digest `sha256:97493f99...` |
| `rustc -O` scratch repro of the self-update collision | confirmed `hard_link`/`copy` both fail with ENOENT against a rewritten own-exe path |
| `grep -a -c "current binary no longer exists" <binary>` (repeated across hosts) | verified fix presence before/after every deploy, never trusted version strings alone |
| `ssh agent-os "MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 schtasks.exe /Create ..."` | Scheduled Task `CortexHeartbeatAgent` created successfully |
| `curl https://cortex.tootie.tv/mcp ... action=fleet_state` | confirmed agent-os heartbeating as hostname `agent-os` after the hostname fix |
| `git push` (via automated session-close protocol) | pushed commits `9633617` and `c124114`; `git status` confirmed clean and up to date |

## Errors Encountered

- **`git stash` mishap**: a chained `git stash && cargo test ...; git stash pop` was killed mid-`cargo test` by the Bash tool's 2-minute default timeout, before `stash pop` ran, silently reverting all tracked changes. Discovered via a binary-content `grep` returning 0 for a string that should have been present. Resolved via `git stash pop` (the stash was never dropped) and a strict verification discipline going forward (grep the actual binary, never trust `--version` alone).
- **Docker permission gap on tootie**: the recreated `cortex-heartbeat-agent` container couldn't reach the Docker socket (UID 1000, socket group `docker`/gid 281, no supplementary group). Fixed with `--group-add 281`.
- **Systemd sandbox gap on steamy-wsl**: `226/NAMESPACE` failure because a newly added `ReadWritePaths` entry pointed at a directory that didn't exist yet. Fixed with `mkdir -p` + `chmod 700`.
- **Accidental duplicate container on shart**: a `docker compose up` run in shart's compose directory unexpectedly matched a service definition there, creating a second, conflicting `compose-cortex-heartbeat-agent-1` container that crash-looped. Removed it and recreated the correct bare `docker run` container directly.
- **Shart permission error post-recreation**: `read /mnt/user/appdata/cortex/heartbeat-host-id: Permission denied` because the recreated container didn't match the original's `--user` (the host-id file is root-owned, 0600). Fixed by adding `--user root` to match the original container's config.
- **Two stale pre-existing test failures**, unrelated to this session's diff: `cli::parse::tests::parser_top_level_commands_are_classified_in_surfaces` and `tests::mode_parse_keeps_runtime_status_mcp_only`, both caused by commit `d705740` (pre-session) adding a real `cortex status` CLI command without registering it in `src/surfaces.rs` or updating the CLI-routing test in `src/main_tests.rs`. Fixed both.
- **A third instance of the same gap**, found on the subsequent full-suite rerun: `cli::complete::tests::completion_roots_have_help_entries` failed because `status` also had no entry in `src/cli/help.rs`'s `SECTIONS`/`CATALOG`. Fixed.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Area | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `correlate` MCP action | required `reference_time`; `ask_history` was a separate, simpler action | `reference_time` optional — derives it from a `query`-based AI-session search when omitted; `ask_history` removed entirely |
| Agent-forwarded data | syslog, Docker logs, journald, heartbeats only | + AI transcripts (Claude/Codex/Gemini), + shell history (zsh/atuin), + agent-run commands (chunked, no more 413s) |
| Self-update failure logging | `error = %error` truncated to the outermost `anyhow` context, hiding the real OS error | full error chain (`{error:#}`) logged everywhere in the self-update/forwarder code paths |
| Self-update on exe collision | silent, indefinite ENOENT retry loop with no useful diagnosis | fails fast with an explicit "likely replaced by something other than self-update, e.g. a concurrent rebuild" message |
| agent-os (Windows) | no running agent, no scheduled task, hostname detection non-functional on Windows | Scheduled Task running at logon, heartbeating to production as hostname `agent-os` |
| `cortex status` CLI command | parseable (per pre-session commit `d705740`) but absent from the surfaces registry, contradicted by a stale routing test, and undocumented in `--help` | fully registered, tested, and documented |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo test --release` (final) | 0 failures | 515 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored | pass |
| `cargo clippy --release --all-targets` | no warnings | clean | pass |
| `grep -a -c "current binary no longer exists" ~/.local/bin/cortex` (dookie, squirts, steamy-wsl, vivobook-wsl) | 1 | 1 on all four | pass |
| `docker exec cortex-heartbeat-agent grep -a -c "current binary no longer exists" /usr/local/bin/cortex` (tootie, shart) | 1 | 1 on both | pass |
| `docker logs cortex-heartbeat-agent --tail 10` (tootie, shart) post-recreate | no errors after startup transient | clean on both after the permission/network fixes | pass |
| `curl .../fleet_state` for hostname `agent-os` | present, status ok/partial | present, `status: partial` (expected — Windows lacks the Linux-only disk/network `/proc` probes) | pass |
| `git status` after push | clean, up to date with `origin/main` | confirmed | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- The `ensure_binary_still_present()` guard is additive and fails closed (skips the update cycle, leaves the current binary running) — no behavior-changing risk to production self-update.
- The Docker container recreations on tootie/shart changed `--network`/`--user`/`--group-add` flags; if either regresses, the prior bare `docker run` invocations are fully recorded in this log's Sequence of Events and can be reproduced exactly.
- agent-os's Scheduled Task runs under the interactive user at logon (`ONLOGON`), not as a system service — if the VM is rebooted without an interactive logon, the agent won't start until one occurs. Acceptable for a personal dev sandbox; would need `ONSTART` + a service account for anything more critical.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not attempt to fix shart's Docker healthcheck showing `unhealthy` despite clean logs (likely a misapplied HTTP healthcheck on a container that doesn't serve one) — flagged to the user as a known cosmetic issue rather than silently changed, since it wasn't part of what was asked and the fix (removing or correcting the healthcheck definition) touches shart's compose/run configuration outside this session's scope.
- Did not patch `heartbeat_agent.rs`'s cross-platform `hostname()` function itself for the Windows gap — fixed at the deployment layer (`$env:HOSTNAME` in the wrapper script) instead, since it's a single-host quirk not worth adding Windows-specific code paths to the core binary for.

## Open Questions

- `plugins/cortex/skills/redeploy/SKILL.md` and `plugins/cortex/skills/redeploy/agents/openai.yaml` remain deleted-but-uncommitted in the working tree, predating this session. Unclear whether this was intentional (e.g. redeploy skill superseded/renamed) or an accidental leftover from an earlier, uncommitted cleanup pass. Needs the user's decision on whether to commit the deletion, restore the files, or leave as-is.

## Next Steps

- Decide on the dangling `plugins/cortex/skills/redeploy/` deletion (commit, restore, or continue leaving dirty).
- Optionally address shart's cosmetic Docker healthcheck `unhealthy` label if it's noisy for monitoring/alerting.
- No other unfinished work from this session — the four explicitly requested follow-up items (commit/push, fleet rollout including the fix, agent-os setup, vivobook-wsl reachability) are all complete and verified.
