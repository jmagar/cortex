## User Request

Run CLAUDE.md audit, address all PR #39 review comments, fix `syslog doctor` errors, prevent the named-volume split-brain from recurring, test the syslog tool, and clean up production — ending with v0.27.2 released.

## Session Overview

Wide-ranging operations session covering: CLAUDE.md quality audit and improvement, systematic resolution of all 27 PR #39 CodeRabbit threads, production debugging and remediation (`syslog doctor` showed 3 errors), permanent prevention of the Docker named-volume database split-brain, PR #39 merge, v0.27.1 release, hostname normalization (Docker host IP and AI-watcher `localhost`), DB backfill, local timezone display for all CLI output, and v0.27.2 release.

## Sequence of Events

1. **CLAUDE.md audit** — ran `/claude-md-management:claude-md-improver`; root CLAUDE.md scored 72/100 (stale version, missing files, incomplete CLI table); applied 5 targeted fixes
2. **PR #39 review — round 2** (11 CodeRabbit threads): fixed `journalctl` timeout, `hostname+service` guard in `incident`, `dropped_lines` surfacing, HTTP-flags error message, `syslog search` help text, `doctor_tests.rs` sidecar; rejected 4 camelCase-in-Rust threads (would break clippy)
3. **PR #39 review — round 3** (2 cubic-dev-ai threads): fixed `dropped_lines` unreachable-when-all-malformed bug, fixed `syslog db backup` example in CLAUDE.md
4. **Version bump 0.27.0 → 0.27.1** via `/quick-push`; CI passed; pushed v0.27.1 tag; resolved GHCR publish failure (wrong image tag default `0.27.1` not yet released); pinned `SYSLOG_MCP_VERSION=0.27.0` in `.env`
5. **`syslog doctor` debug** — systematic investigation of 3 errors:
   - `data_volume_not_bind` / `data_volume`: container used stale Docker named volume `compose_syslog-mcp-data` (project name had changed); two diverged databases found (19GB Docker volume, 24GB bind mount)
   - `runtime_current`: CLI binary at 0.26.0, container at 0.27.0; misleading error message
6. **User decision**: delete both databases, start fresh
7. **Container rebuild** — `syslog compose up --allow-cwd-target` failed: (a) `docker-compose.prod.yml` missing from Dockerfile COPY; (b) `SYSLOG_API_TOKEN` not in repo `.env`; (c) dev override in `~/.syslog-mcp/compose/` intercepting prod pulls
8. **Named-volume split-brain prevention**: added `name: ${SYSLOG_MCP_VOLUME_NAME:-syslog-mcp-data}` to volume declaration; added `volume_name` field to `MountInfo`; replaced "error if not bind" with name-based check; added pre-flight guard in `validate_mutation` refusing `syslog compose up` when running container uses unexpected volume name; updated doctor to accept correctly-named volumes
9. **Merged PR #39** via `gh pr merge 39 --squash --delete-branch`; pushed `v0.27.1` tag; watched build workflow; pulled and deployed `ghcr.io/jmagar/syslog-mcp:0.27.1` to production
10. **Hostname normalization**:
    - `SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS`: changed `100.88.16.79` → `dookie` in `~/.syslog-mcp/.env`
    - `localhost` in AI transcript entries: `src/scanner.rs:553` hardcoded `"localhost"` → `local_hostname()` using `gethostname(2)` via libc
    - DB backfill: `UPDATE logs SET hostname='dookie' WHERE hostname IN ('localhost','100.88.16.79')` + `hosts` table merge (76,968 rows)
11. **Local timezone display**: added `local_ts()` helper in `src/cli.rs`; applied to all human-readable print functions
12. **v0.27.2 release** via `just publish patch`; removed `data/` dir from repo root; removed dev override from `~/.syslog-mcp/compose/`; confirmed `syslog doctor` clean; pruned stale remote branch ref

## Key Findings

- `compose_syslog-mcp-data` Docker volume name had `compose_` prefix from an old `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`; adding `name:` to the volume declaration prevents this permanently — Docker Compose no longer project-prefixes explicitly named volumes
- `check-runtime-current.sh` rejected `syslog-mcp:dev` image and non-canonical compose dirs, causing false `runtime_current` errors for any dev deployment
- `doctor.rs:421-428`: `Some(false)` branch showed hardcoded "container X != repo Y" message regardless of actual script failure reason; fixed to show real script output
- `config/Dockerfile:22`: `COPY docker-compose.yml ./` was missing `docker-compose.prod.yml`, causing `include_str!("../docker-compose.prod.yml")` in `src/setup.rs:10` to fail at compile time inside Docker
- `src/scanner.rs:553`: `"localhost".to_string()` — every AI transcript entry was stamped with `localhost` regardless of actual machine hostname
- `src/cli.rs` all print functions: timestamps were raw RFC3339 UTC strings; `chrono::Local` conversion via `local_ts()` helper

## Technical Decisions

- **Named volume `name:` fix over bind-mount enforcement**: Named volumes are valid and portable; the real problem was unstable names from project-name changes. Explicit `name:` is the minimal, correct fix.
- **`gethostname(2)` via libc over `$HOSTNAME` env var**: `$HOSTNAME` is bash-specific and not inherited by all subprocess environments. `gethostname` syscall is authoritative.
- **DB backfill via direct SQLite**: Used `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction directly rather than via app, since the data migration was a one-time operation and the app has no bulk-rename API.
- **camelCase-in-Rust threads rejected**: CodeRabbit applied a JS/TS rule to Rust files. `cargo clippy -D warnings` enforces `non_snake_case`, making camelCase Rust locals a lint error. Replied with rationale rather than silently closing.
- **`local_ts()` at display layer only**: JSON output left as UTC RFC3339. Local conversion happens only in human-readable print functions, preserving machine-parseable output.

## Errors Encountered

| Error | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `syslog compose up` refused with `--allow-cwd-target` | Dev compose triggered Docker build; `docker-compose.prod.yml` not in Dockerfile COPY | Added to COPY line in `config/Dockerfile` |
| Container restart loop: `SYSLOG_API_TOKEN required` | Repo `.env` lacked token; `env_file` in compose loaded repo `.env` not `~/.syslog-mcp/.env` | Added generated token to repo `.env` |
| `v0.27.1` image not found on first `compose pull` | Tag pushed on feature branch before merge; image build only runs on main/tags | Merged PR first, then pushed tag separately |
| `build-and-push` workflow failed for `v0.27.1` tag | `server.json` had both `"version"` field and versioned `identifier`; MCP Registry rejects redundant `version` | Removed `version` from OCI package entry |
| `runtime_current` showed `0.27.1 != 0.27.1` | `check-runtime-current.sh` failed with "non-canonical compose dir" before version check; error message was hardcoded | Fixed script to accept dev image/dir; fixed doctor to show actual failure reason |

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `syslog hosts` timestamps | UTC RFC3339 (`2026-05-21T06:02:51.777Z`) | Local time (`2026-05-21 02:02:51 -04:00`) |
| AI transcript hostname | `localhost` for all entries | Actual machine hostname (`dookie`) |
| Docker host log hostname | `100.88.16.79` for dookie container logs | `dookie` |
| `syslog compose up` with stale volume | Silently created second orphaned database | Hard error naming actual vs expected volume |
| `syslog doctor` on named volume | Error: `/data is a volume (not a bind mount)` | OK if volume name matches; Error only on unexpected name |
| `syslog compose up` on dev image | `runtime_current` error: `0.27.1 != 0.27.1` | Passes — dev image and repo dir accepted |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| `syslog doctor` | All checks passed | All checks passed | ✓ |
| `syslog hosts` | `dookie` only, no IP or localhost | `dookie`, `squirts`, `tootie`, `shart`, `vivobook`, `STEAMY` | ✓ |
| `docker inspect syslog-mcp --format '{{.Config.Image}}'` | `ghcr.io/jmagar/syslog-mcp:0.27.1` | `ghcr.io/jmagar/syslog-mcp:0.27.1` | ✓ |
| `cargo test` | 899 passed | 899 passed | ✓ |
| `gh pr checks 39` | All green | All green | ✓ |
| `syslog stats` | DB active, logs ingesting | 284k+ logs, 7 hosts, write not blocked | ✓ |

## Open Questions

- **UniFi gateway**: user noted it was appearing in hosts; not visible in current DB (wiped at session start). Will appear under its syslog-reported hostname once it sends again. Hostname format unknown until observed.
- **`data/` DB content**: dev bind-mount DB at `./data/syslog.db` was deleted. Any logs accumulated during that short dev container window are gone (expected, confirmed by user).

## Next Steps

**Unfinished from this session:** none.

**Follow-on tasks:**
- After CI publishes `ghcr.io/jmagar/syslog-mcp:0.27.2`: update `SYSLOG_MCP_VERSION=0.27.1` → `0.27.2` in `~/.syslog-mcp/.env` and run `syslog compose up`
- Monitor `syslog hosts` to confirm UniFi gateway appears and identify its hostname
- Consider retroactive rename of `STEAMY` → `steamy` (lowercase) if desired — same SQL pattern as dookie backfill
- `syslog setup repair` does not propagate the `name:` volume fix to the installed compose when it already exists — consider adding version-aware compose update logic to setup.rs
