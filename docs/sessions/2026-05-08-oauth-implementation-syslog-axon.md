## User Request

Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for the syslog-mcp MCP server using a shared `lab-auth` crate extracted from the lab homelab gateway, supporting both static bearer tokens and Google-backed JWTs simultaneously. After implementation, replicate the same OAuth pattern for `axon_rust`.

## Session Overview

Implemented end-to-end OAuth 2.0 for two Rust MCP servers (syslog-mcp and axon_rust) using a shared `lab-auth` crate. The lab-auth crate was refactored from a lab-specific library into a parameterizable shared crate. Both services now support Google OAuth login with PKCE, JWT issuance, scope-based authorization, and dynamic client registration — alongside the existing static bearer token. The full flow was debugged live against Claude Code and claude.ai clients, exposing and fixing several production issues.

## Sequence of Events

1. **Planning phase**: Explored lab-auth codebase (~6,900 LOC), designed 10-bead epic (`syslog-mcp-brt0`) for OAuth port. Multiple research rounds (6 agents), design reviews (24 recommendations applied), engineering review (5 critical + 8 important findings).

2. **Lab-auth crate refactor** (lab PRs: L1–L3):
   - L1: Parameterized all `"lab"`-branded constants (env prefix, scopes, resource path, cookie name). Added `AuthConfigBuilder` consuming-builder pattern. JWKS 5s timeout. JWT issuer in `Validation::set_issuer()` per RFC 7519.
   - L2: Moved `authenticate_request` middleware into `AuthLayer` (Tower `Layer` impl). Added `bearer_only_router()` and `router()`. `AuthContext` type moved to crate.
   - L3: Updated lab consumer to use parameterized crate; deleted ~322 LOC of duplicated middleware.
   - Lab PR #51 merged at SHA `87cec324`.

3. **syslog-mcp integration** (bead waves S1–S6):
   - S1: Added lab-auth dep (git+rev), `AuthConfig` in config.rs, 5 OAuth env vars, non-loopback safety gate using `IpAddr::is_loopback()`.
   - S2: `AuthPolicy` enum on `AppState` (Mounted/LoopbackDev), `AuthState` initialized in `RuntimeCore`, backup scripts updated.
   - S3: Replaced legacy `require_auth` middleware with `AuthLayer`, de-duplicated between `mcp/routes.rs` and `api.rs`.
   - S4: Mounted full OAuth router (`/register`, `/.well-known/*`, `/jwks`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/auth/google/callback`). Extended CORS/Host allowlist from `SYSLOG_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`.
   - S5: Fail-closed scope check via `AuthPolicy` enum match. `tools/list` exempt from scope. AuthContext via rmcp extension propagation (Pattern (a) confirmed by spike B0).
   - S6: Integration tests (266 total), OAuth docs (`docs/OAUTH.md`), smoke test extension, SHA-bump automation.
   - syslog-mcp PR #17 merged at `e40f54b`.

4. **Review passes**: lavra-review (4 agents), simplify (2 fixes), pr-review-toolkit (critical: wrong-key JWT test, wrong aud test, `tools/list` blocked pre-auth), gh-address-comments (19 threads resolved for PR #17, 6 threads for lab PR #51).

5. **Live deployment and debugging**:
   - Deployed OAuth binary via systemd drop-in (`~/.config/systemd/user/syslog-mcp.service.d/oauth.conf`).
   - Fixed DCR: `bearer_only_router()` excludes `/register`; switched to `router()`.
   - Fixed scope validation: lab-auth rejected `syslog:read syslog:admin` (space-separated); added multi-scope support in `authorize.rs`.
   - Fixed SWAG proxy for `syslog.tootie.tv`: removed `oauth.conf` include, added direct OAuth endpoint routes. Fixed `WWW-Authenticate` path-based PRM URL (`/mcp/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`).
   - Fixed claude.ai redirect URI: added `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` to `allowed_client_redirect_uris`.
   - OAuth flow verified end-to-end: Claude Code plugin authenticated successfully.

6. **Post-merge bug fixes** (PR #18):
   - `required_scope_for` fallback was fail-permissive (`Some("syslog:read")` → `Some("syslog:__deny__")`); 12 missing valid actions added.
   - `build_auth_layer` didn't set `static_token_scopes` in bearer-only mode; static bearer got empty scopes and failed all scope checks.

7. **axon_rust OAuth** (PR #76, #77):
   - Dispatched agent to implement OAuth matching syslog-mcp's pattern. Key difference: axon uses sqlx-sqlite 0.8 which pins `libsqlite3-sys 0.30`, conflicting with lab-auth's rusqlite 0.39. Resolved by vendoring lab-auth with rusqlite downgraded to 0.32.
   - PR #76 merged. Post-merge fixes: fail-conservative scope default, artifacts/scrape write scope, x-api-key header normalization.
   - Configured SWAG proxy for `axon.tootie.tv` matching syslog pattern.
   - Discovered rmcp `StreamableHttpServerConfig` didn't have `with_allowed_hosts` set → requests from Cloudflare rejected. Fixed in PR #77.

## Key Findings

- **rmcp extension propagation (B0 spike)**: Pattern (a) confirmed — `ctx.extensions.get::<axum::http::request::Parts>()?.extensions.get::<AuthContext>()` works in rmcp 1.6 with `stateful_mode=false`. The research finding claiming it didn't was wrong.
- **scope validation**: `validate_scope` in lab-auth only accepted exact `default_scope` match; MCP clients send `syslog:read syslog:admin` as a space-separated string. Fixed in lab-auth `authorize.rs:431`.
- **DCR flow**: `bearer_only_router()` excludes `/register` unconditionally; Claude Code MCP SDK requires DCR. Must use `router()` (full) with `enable_dynamic_registration(true)`.
- **path-based PRM**: `WWW-Authenticate` header points to `<resource_url>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (e.g., `https://syslog.tootie.tv/mcp/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`). SWAG must proxy this path to the upstream.
- **rmcp allowed_hosts** (axon): `StreamableHttpServerConfig::default()` only allows loopback. Must call `.with_allowed_hosts(...)` with the public hostname to allow requests from external reverse proxies.
- **libsqlite3-sys conflict** (axon): sqlx-sqlite 0.8 pins `libsqlite3-sys 0.30`; rusqlite 0.39 requires `0.37`. Both declare `links = "sqlite3"` — Cargo hard error. Vendored lab-auth with rusqlite 0.32.

## Technical Decisions

- **Shared crate (Route B)** over copy-and-adapt: single source of truth for OAuth primitives; security fixes propagate to both syslog-mcp and axon. git+rev pinned at SHA, not path dep (CI safety).
- **AuthPolicy enum** (not bool): `Mounted { auth_state: Option<Arc<AuthState>> }` and `LoopbackDev`. No `Default` impl — every constructor must name a variant. Guards against accidental permit-without-context.
- **Fail-closed scope check**: unknown actions return `Some("syslog:__deny__")` sentinel, not `Some("syslog:read")`. A future action added to dispatch but missing from scope map is denied, not silently permitted.
- **Env vars only for secrets/URLs/mode**: TTLs, rate limits, paths, policy flags → `config.toml [mcp.auth]`. Only 5 env vars: `SYSLOG_MCP_AUTH_MODE`, `SYSLOG_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, `SYSLOG_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `SYSLOG_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` + existing `SYSLOG_MCP_TOKEN`.
- **systemd drop-in** for deployment: `~/.config/systemd/user/syslog-mcp.service.d/oauth.conf` survives plugin system resets.
- **Full OAuth router** (not bearer_only_router): needed for DCR (`/register`). The distinction matters — `bearer_only_router` was designed for headless consumers that don't need browser flows.

## Errors Encountered

| Error | Root cause | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `scope must be syslog:read` on `/authorize` | `validate_scope` only accepted exact `default_scope` string, not space-separated combinations | Added multi-scope validation in `lab-auth/src/authorize.rs:431` |
| `/register` returns 404 | `bearer_only_router` excludes `/register` unconditionally | Switched to `router()` with `enable_dynamic_registration(true)` |
| `403 Forbidden: Host header is not allowed` (axon via Cloudflare) | `StreamableHttpServerConfig::default()` only allows loopback; external hosts rejected at rmcp layer before axon middleware | Added `with_allowed_hosts(...)` from `AXON_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `mcp_http_router` |
| Stdio mode crashes (`Config::load()` rejects `0.0.0.0` without auth) | `validate_auth_config` ran before stdio mode could override the bind check | Added `Config::load_for_stdio()` that skips the bind gate; `query_only()` forces `LoopbackDev` |
| `libsqlite3-sys` link conflict in axon | sqlx-sqlite 0.8 pins `libsqlite3-sys 0.30`; rusqlite 0.39 needs `0.37`; Cargo rejects duplicate `links = "sqlite3"` | Vendored lab-auth with rusqlite 0.32 |
| Static bearer token gets 403 on scope-gated actions | `build_auth_layer` didn't call `with_static_token_scopes` in bearer-only mode; `AuthLayer` initialized scopes as empty | Added `.with_static_token_scopes(["syslog:read","syslog:admin"])` conditionally in bearer-only branch |

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `/mcp` auth | Static bearer token only (`SYSLOG_MCP_TOKEN`) | Static bearer + Google OAuth JWTs; both work simultaneously |
| Scope enforcement | None — any authenticated caller could call any action | Fail-closed: `syslog:read` for all 18 read actions; unknown → denied |
| OAuth discovery | No endpoints | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/jwks`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`, `/auth/google/callback` |
| Redirect URI allowlist | N/A | `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` explicitly allowed |
| Stdio mode (`cargo run -- mcp`) | Bearer token validated against static token | Always `LoopbackDev` (no auth enforced; process isolation is trust boundary) |

## Verification Evidence

## Risks and Rollback

- **lab-auth rev pin**: syslog-mcp pins lab-auth at SHA `87cec324`. If lab-auth changes break compatibility, update the rev in `Cargo.toml` and rebuild. A weekly GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/lab-auth-bump.yml`) handles automated bumps.
- **axon libsqlite3-sys vendoring**: axon vendors lab-auth with rusqlite 0.32. If rusqlite API changes, update the vendor copy. Track upstream when sqlx-sqlite or rusqlite resolve the conflict.
- **Rollback syslog-mcp**: Set `SYSLOG_MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer` + `SYSLOG_MCP_TOKEN=<token>` in the systemd drop-in env file. The server falls to bearer-only mode without touching the binary.
- **Rollback axon**: Same — `AXON_MCP_AUTH_MODE` absent defaults to bearer mode; `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` continues to work.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Copy-and-adapt (Route A)**: Vendoring ~3,000 LOC of OAuth primitives into syslog-mcp avoided. Chosen: shared git+rev dep so security fixes propagate to both services.
- **mcp-auth.tootie.tv as external AS**: The homelab already runs `mcp-auth.tootie.tv` as a central OAuth server. Rejected in favor of each service owning its OAuth AS, matching the planned architecture.
- **Browser sessions** (`/auth/login`): Excluded from syslog-mcp since no browser-facing routes exist. The full `router()` does mount `/auth/login`; syslog-mcp doesn't wire the cookie middleware.
- **RFC 9700 refresh token rotation**: Deferred. Mitigated by reducing default refresh TTL from 30d → 8h. The 30d non-rotating tokens are a normative MUST violation per RFC 9700 for public clients.

## Open Questions

- **Refresh token rotation**: RFC 9700 MUST for public clients. Currently 8h non-rotating. Needs a follow-up bead in lab-auth.
- **`/auth/login` mounted on syslog-mcp**: The full `router()` mounts `/auth/login` (browser session flow). syslog-mcp doesn't wire the cookie middleware so it's a dead endpoint — but it's reachable at `https://syslog.tootie.tv/auth/login`. Low risk but inconsistent.
- **axon vendor drift**: axon's vendored lab-auth will fall behind upstream. No automation tracks this. Ideally resolve the rusqlite conflict upstream.

## Next Steps

**Started but not fully complete:**
- axon OAuth flow still not end-to-end verified (host allowlist fix deployed but live client test interrupted)

**Follow-on tasks not yet started:**
- Merge axon PR #77 fixes back into main and rebuild deployed binary with final version
- Set up SWAG proxy for `axon.tootie.tv` `/mcp` — currently serves but the axon binary rebuilds need to be redone from main (not the worktree)
- Add `axon:write` scope enforcement in axon's action dispatch (currently only `axon:read`/`axon:write` mapped for known actions)
- RFC 9700 refresh token rotation — create a follow-up bead in lab-auth
- Publish `lab-auth` to crates.io (deferred; currently git+rev dep)
- Resolve axon/syslog-mcp `libsqlite3-sys` version conflict at source (upgrade sqlx-sqlite or rusqlite)
