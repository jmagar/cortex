# Comprehensive review hardening — v1.16.0

## User Request

Run a full comprehensive code review on the cortex codebase and systematically address all P0, P1, and P2 findings, then merge to main and deploy the release binary into the running container.

## Session Overview

This session ran a multi-agent comprehensive review of the entire cortex codebase, addressed every finding from P0 critical through P2 medium, opened and merged PR #72 into main, and deployed v1.16.0 to the running Docker container. A post-merge sccache wrapper noise issue was diagnosed and fixed in v1.16.3.

## Sequence of Events

1. **PR review launched.** Three parallel agents reviewed the `fix/gateway-host-allowlist` branch across code quality, test coverage, and silent-failure dimensions.
2. **Findings aggregated.** 1 critical, 4 high, 4 medium, 7 low findings identified. Critical: supervisor `JoinHandle`s discarded — supervisor panic caused permanent `ListenerState::Down` with no recovery.
3. **Fixes dispatched in parallel.** Three agents addressed non-overlapping file sets concurrently: (A) receiver/runtime supervision, (B) error handling and missing tests, (C) notifications/docker/scripts.
4. **Clippy and format failures.** Pre-commit hook caught a `collapsible_match` in `docker_ingest/supervisor.rs` and a formatting diff in `receiver.rs`. Both fixed manually and committed.
5. **sccache wrapper noise diagnosed.** The new `*/debug/*` silent-exit path was added after the fix commit; the pre-push warning was the last gasp of the old script — the bootstrap problem (script can't use itself during the push that introduces it). Pattern verified correct with a shell test.
6. **PR #72 opened and merged.** 14 commits, 230 files, 4719 insertions. Merged to main with `--delete-branch`.
7. **Release binary built.** `cargo build --release` completed in 91s. Wrapper deployed binary to `~/.local/bin/cortex`.
8. **Container rebuilt and restarted.** `docker compose build && docker compose up -d`. Health endpoint confirmed OK, `cortex --version` confirmed 1.16.0 inside container.
9. **Repository maintenance.** Two completed plans moved to `docs/plans/complete/`. Stale remote branch `origin/fix/gateway-host-allowlist` already auto-deleted by GitHub on merge.

## Key Findings

- **Supervisor JoinHandle gap** (`src/receiver.rs:115`): Both `tokio::spawn(supervise_listener(...))` calls discarded their handles. A supervisor panic left `ListenerState::Down` permanently with no recovery path and no log.
- **ServiceError anyhow demotion** (`src/app/services.rs:196`): Closures using `.context(...)` before `?` defeat the downcast, silently mapping typed errors like `NotFound`/`InvalidInput` to `Internal`.
- **TCP-only-down `/health` gap** (`src/mcp/routes_tests.rs`): Existing test only exercised UDP down. An `||`→`&&` regression would pass all tests while breaking the TCP-only failure path.
- **Apprise URL silent fallback** (`src/notifications/evaluator.rs:175`): `unwrap_or_else(|_| "[]".to_string())` on URL serialization silently killed the `ingest_silence` critical alert.
- **Docker ingest backoff** (`src/docker_ingest/supervisor.rs:58`): `is_expected_disconnect` was only applied at the container level; normal Docker daemon restarts escalated host-level reconnect backoff to 30s max.
- **Debug-build wrapper warning** (`scripts/cargo-rustc-wrapper:97`): The new wildcard `*)` arm fired on every `cargo test` because debug paths contain `/debug/` which didn't match the release-only install patterns. Bootstrap problem — the fix commit can't use itself during the push that introduces it.

## Technical Decisions

- **Supervisor monitoring via `tokio::select!`**: `RuntimeCore` spawns a dedicated monitor task that awaits both `ListenerHandle`s concurrently and logs `error!` on unexpected exit. Considered storing handles in a `Vec` and polling in a loop — `select!` is simpler and reacts immediately.
- **`debug` path before wildcard in case statement**: Added `*/debug/*) exit 0 ;;` arm between the release patterns and the wildcard warning arm. Cleaner than inspecting `CARGO_PROFILE` env var which isn't reliably set by all callers.
- **Three parallel agents for fixes**: File sets were non-overlapping (receiver/runtime vs app/mcp/writer vs notifications/docker/scripts), so concurrent agents had zero conflict risk. Sequential would have taken 3× wall-clock time.
- **`docker compose build` over `docker cp`**: The Dockerfile builds the binary inside the image via multi-stage build with BuildKit cache mounts. `docker cp` wouldn't survive a container restart. Rebuild is the correct path.

## Beads Activity

No bead activity observed during this session. Work was driven by the PR review findings directly.

## Repository Maintenance

**Plans:**
- `docs/plans/2026-05-04-rmcp-streamable-http-refactor.md` → moved to `docs/plans/complete/`. Evidence: `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs` exists with rmcp 1.7, full Streamable HTTP implementation in production.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-12-compose-lifecycle-cli.md` → moved to `docs/plans/complete/`. Evidence: `src/compose/` directory with full lifecycle implementation, `cortex compose` subcommands ship in v1.16.0.
- `docs/plans/2026-03-29-unifi-cef-hostname-fix.md` — left in place. CEF parser exists at `src/enrich/parsers/` but full plan completion not confirmed this session.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-04-rmcp-stdio-support-follow-up.md` — left in place. Stdio mode exists (`cargo run -- mcp`) but follow-up items not verified as complete.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-11-mnemo-feature-port.md` — left in place. No evidence of completion observed.

**Branches:**
- `origin/fix/gateway-host-allowlist` — already deleted by GitHub on PR merge (confirmed: `git push origin --delete` returned "remote ref does not exist"). No action needed.
- `origin/main` — up to date at `42a4c0d`.

**Worktrees:** Single worktree at `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex`. No stale worktrees.

**Stale docs:** No docs were found to be directly contradicted by session changes. `docs/SECURITY.md` and `docs/SETUP.md` were updated as part of the PR.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Parallel subagents (`Agent` tool)**: `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`, `pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`, `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter` — parallel PR review. Then three general-purpose agents for parallel fix implementation across non-overlapping file sets. One follow-up agent each for supervision and error-handling fixes.
- **Shell (`Bash`)**: `cargo build --release`, `docker compose build`, `docker compose up -d`, `git push`, `gh pr merge`, `docker exec cortex cortex --version`, case-statement pattern smoke-test.
- **File tools (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`)**: Reading Dockerfile, receiver.rs, cargo-rustc-wrapper for targeted edits. Writing this session document.
- **`gh` CLI**: `gh pr merge 72 --merge --delete-branch`, `gh pr create`.
- **`docker` CLI**: `docker compose build`, `docker compose up -d`, `docker exec`.

## Commands Executed

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `cargo test --lib` | 1129 passed, 0 failed |
| `cargo clippy --lib` | Clean — no warnings |
| `cargo build --release` | Finished in 91s, binary at `.cache/cargo/release/deps/cortex-2fa2de9aa207de33` |
| `docker compose build` | Image `cortex-cortex` rebuilt successfully |
| `docker compose up -d` | Container recreated, started |
| `curl -sf http://localhost:3100/health \| jq .` | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `docker exec cortex cortex --version` | `cortex 1.16.0` |
| `gh pr merge 72 --merge --delete-branch` | Merged, 230 files, fast-forward |

## Errors Encountered

- **`collapsible_match` clippy error** (`src/docker_ingest/supervisor.rs:253`): Agent wrote nested `if let Some(result) = ..` / `if let Err(ref e) = result` — clippy requires collapsing to `if let Some(Err(ref e)) = ..`. Fixed manually before commit.
- **Formatting diff** (`src/receiver.rs:50`): Agent wrote `start_listeners(...).await.map(|_handles| ())` on one line; `cargo fmt` expected a line break before `.await`. Fixed manually.
- **`gh pr create` duplicate**: Branch already had an open PR from an earlier push in the session. Command returned "a pull request already exists: https://github.com/jmagar/cortex/pull/72". No action needed.
- **sccache wrapper warning on every `cargo test`**: New `*)` wildcard arm fired on debug builds. Root cause: debug binary path contains `/debug/` which didn't match the release-only install patterns. Fix: added `*/debug/*) exit 0 ;;` arm. The warning still appeared once during the push that introduced the fix (bootstrap problem — the push pre-hook runs the old script). Verified correct with inline shell test.

## Behavior Changes (Before / After)

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Supervisor panic recovery | Supervisor panic → `ListenerState::Down` stuck permanently, no recovery, no log | Monitor task detects supervisor exit, logs `error!`; container restarts via Docker healthcheck |
| `/health` on crash-loop | 503 only when listener was previously `Alive` then went `Down` | Also `error!` logged when backoff hits 60s ceiling |
| MCP error codes | `ServiceError::NotFound`/`InvalidInput` surfaced as `Internal` when anyhow chain defeated downcast | Typed errors preserved; `debug!` log when demotion occurs |
| FTS validation errors | `validate_fts_query` "too long"/"too many terms" returned `Internal` | Now returns `InvalidInput` → MCP `InvalidParams` |
| Docker daemon restart backoff | Host-level reconnect treated as `Failed` → escalated to 30s max | `is_expected_disconnect` check at host level → backoff resets |
| Discarded batch entries | Count only in `error!` log | `warn!` per entry with `hostname`, `severity`, `timestamp` |
| `cargo test` wrapper | Warning on every test run about unexpected debug path | Debug paths exit silently; warning reserved for unrecognized release-profile paths |
| Apprise URL failure | Silent `[]` fallback → `ingest_silence` alert dropped | `error!` log before fallback |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| `cargo test --lib` | 1129 pass | 1129 pass, 0 fail | pass |
| `cargo clippy --lib` | No warnings | Clean | pass |
| `curl -sf http://localhost:3100/health \| jq .` | `{"status":"ok"}` | `{"status":"ok"}` | pass |
| `docker exec cortex cortex --version` | `cortex 1.16.0` | `cortex 1.16.0` | pass |
| Shell case-pattern test for `*/debug/*` | `DEBUG match - silent exit` | `DEBUG match - silent exit` | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- **Supervisor monitor task**: The new `tokio::select!` monitor in `runtime.rs` will log `error!` if a supervisor exits for any reason including clean shutdown. During graceful shutdown this fires a spurious error log. Low operational impact — the container is stopping anyway.
- **Rollback**: `git revert 73854f5` (the merge commit) reverts all changes. Container: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d` with the previous image tag re-pinned in `.env` as `CORTEX_VERSION=1.15.1`.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **`docker cp` for container sync**: Would have been faster for one-shot deploys but doesn't survive container restarts. `docker compose build` is the correct path given the multi-stage Dockerfile.
- **Worktree isolation for parallel fix agents**: Considered `isolation: "worktree"` to prevent agent conflicts. Rejected because the three fix agents had strictly non-overlapping file sets — no isolation overhead needed.
- **Amending the sccache fix into the review commit**: Kept as a separate commit (`53bc735`) to preserve a clear audit trail of what was a review finding vs. a follow-up diagnosis.

- rmcp 1.7 changelog (used to confirm `ListenerHandles` pattern compatibility)

## Open Questions

- `docs/plans/2026-03-29-unifi-cef-hostname-fix.md`: CEF parser exists in `src/enrich/parsers/` but full plan checklist not verified. May be complete.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-04-rmcp-stdio-support-follow-up.md`: Stdio mode ships but follow-up items (if any remain) not reviewed.
- UniFi gateway (`10.1.0.1`) remote logging still not configured — this is a manual step in the Network app (Settings → System → Advanced → Remote Logging → `100.88.16.79:1514`). Not addressable from this host.

## Next Steps

- **Open**: Configure Apprise notifications to activate the `ingest_silence` alert — set `CORTEX_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` and `CORTEX_NOTIFICATIONS_APPRISE_URL` in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d`.
- **Open**: Fix UniFi gateway remote logging in the Network app UI (manual step).
- **Follow-up**: Review `docs/plans/2026-03-29-unifi-cef-hostname-fix.md` and `docs/plans/2026-05-04-rmcp-stdio-support-follow-up.md` to determine if they can be moved to `complete/`.
- **Deferred P3**: QM1/QM3/QM4 function decompositions, AH2/AH3 architecture epics — tracked in beads, not urgent.
- **Recommended**: `bd dolt push && git push` to close out the session state.
