# Fleet audit, MCP Apps widget fixes, and silence alerting (v3.11.0)

## User Request

Started as "How often do agents send a heartbeat?" and grew through: investigate shart's dead heartbeat + verify all agent versions, fix agent-os partial, deploy the agent to tower, audit whether every host sends all its data, diagnose why the MCP query widget never renders, implement a connector-proof widget fallback, and "make it send gotify notifications if an agent has went >10 mins (configurable) without a heartbeat, and >1 hour (configurable) without sending all of its configured logs" — then merge everything and cut the release.

## Session Overview

Full fleet health audit and repair (7→8 reporting hosts, all agents on 3.10.0), root-caused two long-standing gaps (shart's Unraid license blacklist; the claude.ai connector stripping MCP resources), shipped two features (PR #139 widget connector-proofing, PR #140 heartbeat/stream silence alerts with migration 43), merged both plus the release PR, and published **v3.11.0** (05:46Z). Filed seven beads (two closed with the merged PRs, five open defects). Tootie prod deploy of 3.11.0 was explicitly left pending user go-ahead.

## Sequence of Events

1. **Heartbeat cadence answered**: 30s default (`DEFAULT_INTERVAL_SECS`, src/heartbeat_agent.rs:19); server flags `heartbeat_late` at 2.5× the agent's declared interval (src/app/heartbeat_flags.rs:31).
2. **Ingestion methods enumerated**: 10 paths (2 syslog listeners on 1514; 5 HTTP POST endpoints on 3100 — /v1/logs, /v1/heartbeats, /v1/ai-transcripts, /v1/shell-history, /v1/agent-commands; 3 local/pull — file tails, ai_watch, legacy docker pull). An 8-agent ultracode workflow launched for this was killed after user pushback; answer came from greps. Feedback memory updated.
3. **Fleet triage**: tailscale showed 13/16 nodes online; `fleet_state` showed 6/7 heartbeat agents ok, SHART late since Jul 14, agent-os partial.
4. **shart root cause**: rebooted Jul 14 into an Unraid upgrade; array autostart blocked by `Unregistered Flash device blacklisted (EBLACKLISTED)` / `cmdStart: no registration key` (flash GUID 0781-5575-…, Basic.key present but rejected). Docker (and the cortex agent container, 3.9.1) down until the license/flash is replaced. Not fixable remotely.
5. **agent-os**: runs `C:\cortex\cortex.exe` via scheduled task `\CortexHeartbeatAgent`; probes hardcode /proc paths (src/heartbeat_agent.rs:596,626) so partial is expected on native Windows; agent self-update is `cfg(unix)`-gated (src/agent/self_update.rs) which is why it sat on 3.8.1. Manually updated to 3.10.0 (both C:\cortex and the stale 1.16.5 copy on PATH) and restarted the task.
6. **Version sweep**: dookie/tootie/squirts/steamy/vivobook already 3.10.0 (agents self-update from the server; tootie's container image tag lagged at 3.9.1 while the running binary had self-updated). Recreated tootie's `cortex-heartbeat-agent` container on the 3.10.0 image with identical binds/env.
7. **tower deploy**: enabled Docker on the test Unraid box (docker.cfg + bind-mounted /mnt/cache/system/docker to /var/lib/docker; daemon 29.5.3), deployed the agent container (`--user 0:0` required — non-root default couldn't write the host-id file). First heartbeat accepted; fleet went to 8 hosts.
8. **WSL question answered**: steamy and vivobook agents run inside WSL2 (WSL kernels in heartbeats) — WSL metrics + Docker Desktop + /mnt/c covered; Windows event logs are not collected anywhere; agent-os is the only native-Windows agent and sends heartbeats only.
9. **Data-completeness audit**: docker container logs confirmed flowing from dookie/tootie/squirts as `agent-docker` kind (the `docker-stream` filter enum is the legacy pull path — initial "zero docker logs" was a wrong-enum artifact plus pre-upgrade rows whose `[cortex-agent-docker-meta:…]` marker was unstripped; the server's same-night 3.10.0 upgrade fixed extraction). Found: oversize TCP lines (>8 KiB, Plex tail) drop AND close the connection (stats: 27 drops == 27 closes; src/receiver/listener.rs:301); agent-command rows stamp hostname=localhost; gemini transcript parse-warn spam loops back through journald; SWAG/AdGuard file-based logs aren't captured (stdout-only forwarder) — offered a file-tails addition, not requested.
10. **Widget diagnosis**: "Rendering widget cortex" placeholder — server verified correct (advertises resources, serves ui://cortex/query-widget as text/html;profile=mcp-app), but the claude.ai connector path reports "Server does not support resources", so MCP Apps hosts can never hydrate `_meta.ui.resourceUri`. Also: `cortex.tootie.tv/mcp` is Host-allowlist-rejected; only `cortex.dinglebear.ai` works externally.
11. **PR #139** (merged `ff696b91`): opt-in `CORTEX_WIDGET_EMBED` embedded-resource fallback (audience=user) on search/filter/tail/errors results; dual-format tool meta (flat `ui/resourceUri` + nested `ui`) per the ext-apps SDK; full MCP Apps JSON-RPC-over-postMessage bridge in query_widget.html (`ui/initialize` handshake, `tools/call`, ping/teardown, host-pushed tool-result rendering) — without which even a rendering host's Search button dead-ended.
12. **PR #140** (merged `8e4ec603`): `heartbeat_silence` (critical, default 600s) and `stream_silence` (warning, default 3600s) evaluator rules; `stream_last_seen` rollup (migration 43, `KNOWN_SCHEMA_VERSION` 42→43); once-per-outage dedup keys (stalled last-seen timestamp + host_id in key); 7d forget horizon; six env knobs; evaluator phase 0 rollup maintenance with 24h first-run seeding.
13. **Release**: merged #139 then #140 (squash), waited for release-please to refresh PR #135 with both feats + the sync-version fixup, verified changelog/version carriers, merged #135 with a merge commit (matching 3.10.0 convention). **v3.11.0 published 05:46Z**; tag-triggered archive + Docker builds completed.
14. **repo-status sweep**: clean single-worktree main; `origin/marketplace-no-mcp` protected/self-syncing; two deleted feature refs awaiting local prune.

## Key Findings

- The claude.ai connector proxy exposes tools only — `resources/read` is impossible through it, which breaks all MCP Apps widgets from connector-attached servers (verified: direct initialize shows `"resources":{}`; connector says "does not support resources").
- Agent self-update (`/v1/agent/binary`) masks container image-tag drift; it is unix-only, so Windows agents silently go stale.
- Agent heartbeat container-inventory probe reports `reachable=false` on tootie while the docker log forwarder on the same socket streams fine — probe bug, not a data gap.
- shart's outage is a licensing failure (blacklisted flash GUID after the Unraid upgrade), not a cortex fault; all heartbeats arrive via SWAG on squirts (source_ip 10.1.0.8).
- `syslog_tcp_lines_dropped_oversize == syslog_tcp_connections_closed` (27==27): every oversize line kills the TCP session (listener_tests.rs confirms intended behavior) — Plex's long lines churn tootie's agent link.

## Technical Decisions

- **Once-per-outage alerting** instead of re-paging every dedup window: the stalled last-seen timestamp rides in the dedup key (host_id too, for heartbeats — hostnames collide); shart's multi-day outage becomes one gotify ping.
- **Expected streams learned from observation** (`stream_last_seen` rollup) because agents don't report collector config; kinds allowlisted to the six continuous streams so sporadic AI kinds can't false-alarm.
- **Rollup maintained by the evaluator, not the batch writer**: keeps the ingest hot path untouched; refreshed from the cycle window each pass, seeded from a bounded 24h window on first run instead of a startup-blocking backfill (documented tradeoff: streams silent >24h at seed time never enter).
- **`CORTEX_WIDGET_EMBED` defaults off**: ~16 KiB per result; hosts that ignore `audience` annotations would feed it to the model every query.
- **Release PR merged with a merge commit** (not squash) to match the 3.10.0 `chore: merge release` convention.
- Fleet ops executed inline over SSH rather than via agent fan-out (live-infrastructure mutations; also honoring standing feedback about unrequested agent sweeps).

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: three non-complete files under docs/plans/ (2026-03-29 unifi-cef, 2026-05-04 rmcp-stdio follow-up, 2026-05-11 mnemo port) — none touched by this session, completion not evidenced, left in place.
- **Beads**: all seven session beads handled as above; nothing else claimed or stale-closed.
- **Worktrees/branches**: single worktree on main. Both feature branches deleted locally and on GitHub at merge. `origin/marketplace-no-mcp` is a protected long-lived ref (left alone; its sync workflow ran on both merges). `git fetch --prune` recommended (dry-run showed two deleted remote-tracking refs) but not run — read-only sweep. The release-please working branch regenerated after the post-session fix commits; left to the bot.
- **Stale docs**: CLAUDE.md env docs updated in both feature commits; no other contradicted docs found.
- **Unpushed local commit**: `5e982465 fix(notifications): suppress repeat silence outages` (Jacob, 15:55 EST, outside this session) was ahead of origin/main at save time; the session-log push fast-forwards it to origin per this repo's mandatory-push policy. Flagged here for transparency.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Bash/SSH**: fleet ops on shart/tootie/tower/squirts/agent-os; cargo build/test/clippy/fmt; git/gh. Issues: `rg -rn` twice garbled output (`-r` = replace!); zsh ate unquoted `===` separators; one PowerShell-over-SSH `$`-interpolation failure (fixed by piping the script via stdin); one 2-min push timeout under test-suite load (retried fine).
- **cortex MCP tool** (claude.ai connector): fleet_state, host_state ×7, filter, search, stats, apps, hosts, map findings. The connector server id rotated mid-session (tool reload required); `map mode=findings` degraded (graph projection never built — expected, opt-in).
- **File tools** (Read/Write/Edit) for all code changes; **ToolSearch** for deferred tools (TaskStop, Monitor, resource tools, cortex).
- **ReadMcpResourceTool**: produced the decisive "does not support resources" evidence.
- **Workflow tool**: one 8-agent enumeration workflow launched under ultracode and killed on user pushback — the session's main process error.
- **Monitor + background Bash**: CI/release watchers; one Monitor sat on its 60s poll while the user asked "well?" — direct checks answered faster.
- **Skills**: /mcp-apps:create-mcp-app (ext-apps SDK audit — found the flat meta key and the JSON-RPC bridge gap), /vibin:repo-status, /vibin:save-to-md, create-pr command.
- **Beads (bd)**: create/claim/note/close/search/dolt push throughout.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `ssh shart 'grep -E emhttpd /var/log/syslog.2 …'` | `EBLACKLISTED` / `cmdStart: no registration key` — root cause |
| `ssh tower 'mount --bind /mnt/cache/system/docker /var/lib/docker && /etc/rc.d/rc.docker start'` | Docker 29.5.3 up |
| `docker run … ghcr.io/jmagar/cortex:3.10.0 cortex heartbeat agent …` (tower) | forwarders connected; first heartbeat ok |
| `powershell -Command -` < update script (agent-os) | 3.10.0 installed, task relaunched (PID 3508) |
| `curl POST /mcp initialize` (tootie loopback, bearer) | `"resources":{}` advertised — server side proven correct |
| `cargo test` (full, both branches) | green (2,058+ tests); one fix needed: KNOWN_SCHEMA_VERSION 42→43 |
| `gh pr merge 139/140 --squash`, `gh pr merge 135 --merge` | all merged; v3.11.0 released 05:46Z |

## Errors Encountered

- Full-history "zero docker logs" scare — wrong enum (`docker-stream` = legacy pull) + pre-upgrade unstripped markers; resolved by reading enrichment code and checking a seconds-old row.
- `db::pool` tests failed after migration 43 (`KNOWN_SCHEMA_VERSION` still 42) — bumped, green.
- Tower agent `Permission denied (os error 13)` — image default non-root user; recreated with `--user 0:0`.
- `gh pr checks` awk tallies mangled by spaces in check names; `rg -r` self-inflicted output garbling (twice).
- 8-agent workflow for a bounded factual question — killed; feedback memory strengthened.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Fleet coverage | 7 hosts, shart dead, agent-os on 3.8.1, tower absent | 8 hosts, all agents 3.10.0 (shart pending license), tower reporting |
| Silence alerting | none — shart was silently late for 2.5 days | v3.11.0: gotify ping ≤10 min after a heartbeat stops; ≤1 h after a known stream stops; once per outage |
| MCP widget | permanent "Rendering widget" placeholder via connector; Search dead even where rendered | dual-format meta, real MCP Apps bridge, opt-in embedded fallback (`CORTEX_WIDGET_EMBED`) |
| Release | 3.10.0 | 3.11.0 published (not yet deployed to tootie) |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cortex fleet_state` after tower deploy | Tower present, ok | 8 hosts, Tower ok, first beat 02:51Z | pass |
| `filter host=tootie app=sonarr` | agent_docker metadata row | seconds-old row, `source_kind:"agent-docker"` | pass |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets` (both branches) | 0 errors | 0 (one warning fixed via host_id-in-dedup-key) | pass |
| full `cargo test` (both branches) | green | green | pass |
| `gh pr checks` 139/140/135 | all pass | all pass (cubic "skipping" only) | pass |
| `gh release view v3.11.0` | published | `2026-07-17T05:46:10Z` | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Migration 43 is additive (new empty table); rollback = revert + drop table. `KNOWN_SCHEMA_VERSION` gate means 3.10.x binaries refuse a 43-schema DB — roll back binary+schema together.
- First evaluator cycle on 3.11.0 seeds from 24h of logs (one bounded scan, off the startup path).
- Widget embed is dormant until `CORTEX_WIDGET_EMBED=true`; connector rendering of embedded resources is untested until deployed.
- The post-session `5e982465` dispatcher fix suggests the once-per-outage dedup needed adjustment in practice; it rides to origin with this push.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Batch-writer-maintained rollup (hot-path cost) — evaluator-cycle refresh chosen.
- Startup backfill of stream_last_seen over full retention (would block startup ~minutes on 60M rows).
- Auto-adding SWAG/AdGuard file tails on squirts — offered, awaiting user interest.
- Starting shart's array remotely — impossible (license) and not mine to force.

## References

- PRs: #139, #140, #135 · Release: https://github.com/jmagar/cortex/releases/tag/v3.11.0
- MCP Apps SDK: modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps (RESOURCE_URI_META_KEY, PostMessageTransport, ui/initialize)

## Open Questions

- Does the claude.ai connector render embedded ui:// resources from tool results? Unverifiable until 3.11.0 runs on tootie with `CORTEX_WIDGET_EMBED=true`.
- Why does the containerized agent's docker probe fail while its forwarder works (syslog-mcp-7v8ck)?
- dookie's `cortex-backup.service` is in failed state (observed via systemctl; not investigated).
- incus-web has been tailnet-offline 17 days — intended?

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy 3.11.0 on tootie**: `cortex compose pull && cortex compose up` (was explicitly held for user go-ahead). Expect one shart heartbeat-silence critical immediately.
2. Optionally set `CORTEX_WIDGET_EMBED=true` on tootie and test the connector widget.
3. Replace shart's flash drive / transfer the Unraid license; agent returns with the array (then recreate its container on 3.11.0 or let self-update handle the binary).
4. Work the five open defect beads (cj3ug, 7v8ck, z01or, e4l4d, i6ri8); z01or has a config-only mitigation (`CORTEX_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE=32768` on tootie).
5. `git fetch --prune` to clear the two deleted remote-tracking refs; investigate dookie's failed backup unit.
