# Merge cleanup and session closeout

## User Request

The session started with investigation and planning around Cortex ingestion and graph entity resolution, then the user asked to "proceed with cleaning everything up and merging everything - make sure that absolutely no work is lost." The final request was to run `vibin:save-to-md` and capture the work as a committed markdown session artifact.

## Session Overview

The active Cortex branches were preserved, merged, verified, pushed to `main`, and cleaned up without deleting unmerged or protected work. A backup bundle was created before mutation at `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.git/codex-backups/merge-all-20260713T235354Z`.

The repository was fast-forwarded after remote session-log commits landed, and a maintenance pass confirmed the current `main` tree is clean and current with `origin/main`. An additional Claude worktree exists for open PR #133 and was intentionally left untouched because it is active, clean, tracked, and not merged into `main`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Investigated Cortex runtime and ingestion issues, including collector/service confusion, disabled an unrelated host Codex app server service, and returned focus to session ingestion and graph health.
2. Explored graph relationships across hosts, Docker services, logs, compose files, sessions, repos, PRs, tailscale identities, and app metadata.
3. Planned a clean hard-break canonical entity-resolution milestone with no legacy/backward-compatibility support, using Lavra planning, research, and engineering review flows.
4. Updated bead descriptions from review feedback, produced a full implementation plan, and later merged active release, restore-ingest, update-command, and canonical-plan work into `main`.
5. Resolved integration conflicts, fixed release metadata/package drift, refreshed the yanked `spin` lockfile dependency, pushed `main`, closed stale PR state, and watched GitHub CI/Docker/marketplace workflows to green.
6. Ran the save-to-md maintenance pass, fast-forwarded local `main`, detected the active PR #133 worktree, left it intact, and wrote this session artifact.

## Key Findings

- `origin/main` advanced after the merge with two docs-only commits: `fec31361 docs: save session log` and `c9704b88 docs: update session log with CodeRabbit round`; local `main` was clean and fast-forwarded.
- Latest `main` workflows for `c9704b88` were green: CI, Docker build/push, Sync marketplace-no-mcp, Check no-MCP drift, and release-please.
- A registered worktree exists at `.claude/worktrees/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0`, on branch `claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0`, tied to open PR #133: `feat: canonical entity resolution for the investigation graph`.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0 main` returned nonzero and `main..claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0` showed 72 changed files, so the PR #133 worktree was not safe to remove.
- The Claude transcript path was present and read, but its visible content begins on 2026-07-09 and documents an older Claude `save-to-md` session, not this current Codex closeout.

## Technical Decisions

- Use merge commits and preservation bundles rather than rebasing/deleting unknown work, because the user explicitly prioritized "absolutely no work is lost."
- Keep the existing green `main` CI tooling choices during conflict resolution: `taiki-e/install-action` and the existing `.mise.toml` tool list.
- Treat Docker ingestion parity as an agent-first future concern while not interrupting the requested merge cleanup.
- Fix release metadata drift by making package/server metadata part of `release/components.toml` and package checks, rather than doing a one-off version edit.
- Leave PR #133 and its worktree alone because it is open, pushed, clean, and unmerged.

## Beads Activity

| bead | title | action(s) | final status | why it mattered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `syslog-mcp-ir6xh` | Integrate active Cortex branches and clean worktrees | Created/claimed/closed during merge cleanup | Closed | Tracked the "do not lose work" merge/cleanup task |
| `syslog-mcp-jlih1` | Add cortex update operator workflow | Read as relevant completed work | Closed | The update-command branch merged into `main` |
| `syslog-mcp-tchr5` | Document Cortex graph projection coverage | Read as relevant completed work | Closed | Captures the graph-coverage documentation requested earlier in the session |
| `syslog-mcp-mhkai` | Support remote deploy home override | Read as relevant completed work | Closed | Captures the tootie deploy-home support merged in this session history |
| `syslog-mcp-vkln9` | Add canonical entity resolution for investigation graph | Observed as closed on the active PR #133 workstream | Closed | The milestone was implemented on open PR #133, not merged during this closeout |
| `syslog-mcp-k5i1x`, `syslog-mcp-4hfzi`, `syslog-mcp-k9jnf`, `syslog-mcp-csukc`, `syslog-mcp-5k1zb`, `syslog-mcp-9n4g8`, `syslog-mcp-sfm5o`, `syslog-mcp-6ipjl` | PR #133 review/implementation follow-ups | Read during maintenance pass; no tracker mutation in this save turn | Closed | Evidence that the active PR #133 worktree is live, reviewed, and already tracked |

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

- Checked `docs/plans/`: three top-level plans remain (`2026-03-29-unifi-cef-hostname-fix.md`, `2026-05-04-rmcp-stdio-support-follow-up.md`, `2026-05-11-mnemo-feature-port.md`). They were not moved because this pass did not prove them clearly complete.
- Checked `docs/plans/complete/`: existing completed plans are already under `docs/plans/complete/`.
- Observed many `docs/superpowers/plans/` files, including the canonical entity-resolution and cortex-update-command plans. The skill's move rule targets `docs/plans/`, so those were documented but not reorganized.

### Beads

- Verified `syslog-mcp-ir6xh` is closed with reason: "Merged active branches to main, pushed origin/main, closed stale PR, and cleaned merged worktrees/branches."
- Did not create a follow-up bead for PR #133 because the remaining work is already represented by open PR #133 and its related closed review beads.

### Worktrees and branches

- Local `main` is clean and tracks `origin/main`.
- Registered worktrees: `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex` on `main`, and `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.claude/worktrees/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0` on `claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0`.
- PR #133 is open, not draft, base `main`, head `claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0`; that worktree was left untouched.
- Remote branches observed: `origin/main`, `origin/marketplace-no-mcp`, and `origin/claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0`. The long-lived marketplace branch was preserved.

### Stale docs

- No broad stale-doc rewrite was attempted during save-to-md. The merge itself updated docs relevant to release, package, deploy, update, and graph planning.
- PR #133 contains additional docs updates against `main`; those were not copied into `main` because the PR remains open.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Skills.** `vibin:save-to-md` was used for this artifact. Earlier session context included Lavra planning/research/review and Superpowers writing-plans work.
- **Shell commands.** Used `git`, `gh`, `bd`, `jq`, `find`, `wc`, `du`, `head`, and `tail` for evidence gathering, verification, and repository maintenance.
- **GitHub CLI.** Used for PR and workflow state: PR #131 merged, PR #132 closed, PR #133 open, and latest main/PR workflows green.
- **Beads CLI.** Used to inspect and verify relevant issue status and interactions.
- **File tools.** Used `apply_patch` to write only this session artifact.
- **MCP/browser/subagents.** No MCP tool calls, browser tools, or subagents were used in this save-to-md turn. Earlier session context referenced Lavra-style review/plan flows, but those were not rerun in this closeout.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
| --- | --- |
| `git status --short --branch` | Initially clean but behind `origin/main` by two docs commits; after `git pull --ff-only`, clean and current |
| `git pull --ff-only` | Fast-forwarded `main` from `d4982c52` to `c9704b88` |
| `git worktree list --porcelain` | Found root `main` worktree and active PR #133 Claude worktree |
| `gh pr view 131 --json ...` | PR #131 is merged |
| `gh pr view 132 --json ...` | PR #132 is closed, not merged, because its commits were manually merged to `main` |
| `gh pr view 133 --json ...` | PR #133 is open from `claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0` to `main` |
| `gh run list --branch main --limit 8 --json ...` | Latest `main` CI, Docker build/push, marketplace sync, no-MCP drift, and release-please runs are successful |
| `gh run list --branch claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0 --limit 6 --json ...` | Latest PR #133 CI and Docker runs are successful at `753ae76f`; older run at `32f861d0` failed but was superseded |
| `bd show syslog-mcp-ir6xh` | Merge-cleanup bead is closed with the expected close reason |
| `git diff --name-status dd408c9f^1..d4982c52` | Produced the 48-file merge range table above |
| `git diff --name-status main..claude/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0` | Showed 72 changed files on active PR #133, proving it is not cleanup-safe |

## Errors Encountered

- `gh run watch 29296297104 --exit-status` failed once with a TLS handshake timeout. Resolution: switched to lighter `gh run view` and polling calls.
- The first remote CI run after merging failed `cargo-deny` because locked `spin 0.9.8` was yanked. Resolution: ran `cargo update -p spin`, committed `d4982c52 chore: refresh yanked spin lockfile`, and reran CI to green.
- The injected Claude transcript path existed, but its content visibly describes a July 9 Claude save-to-md session, not this current Codex thread. Resolution: used it only as observed context and recorded the mismatch under Open Questions.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main branch state | Active release/update/restore/canonical-plan branches were not all integrated | `main` contains the merged release, restore-ingest, update-command, canonical-plan, package-check, and lockfile work |
| Release/package metadata | Package and server metadata had version drift risk | Package/server version carriers are covered by release components and package checks |
| CI dependency check | `cargo-deny` failed on yanked `spin 0.9.8` | `Cargo.lock` uses `spin 0.9.9`; dependency check passes |
| Branch cleanup | Stale merged branches/worktrees existed | Merged/stale branches and worktrees from the cleanup task were removed; active PR #133 worktree remains |
| Session documentation | Merge cleanup existed only in chat/logs | This markdown artifact captures the closeout and maintenance evidence |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt --check` | Formatting clean | Passed before final merge closeout | pass |
| `cargo xtask check-version-sync` | Version carriers agree | Passed at 3.10.0 before final merge closeout | pass |
| `cargo xtask check-release-versions` | Release metadata and changelog valid | Passed before final merge closeout | pass |
| `npm --prefix packages/cortex-rmcp run check` | Package metadata valid | Passed before final merge closeout | pass |
| `npm --prefix packages/cortex-rmcp test` | npm launcher tests pass | 4 tests passed before final merge closeout | pass |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` | No clippy warnings | Passed before final merge closeout | pass |
| `cargo test --locked` | Full Rust suite passes | Passed before final merge closeout | pass |
| `cargo deny check` | Dependency policy passes | Failed on yanked `spin 0.9.8`, then passed after `spin 0.9.9` lockfile refresh | pass |
| GitHub `CI` on `d4982c52` | Green | Success | pass |
| GitHub `Build and Push Docker Image` on `d4982c52` | Green | Success | pass |
| GitHub `Sync marketplace-no-mcp` on `d4982c52` | Green | Success | pass |
| GitHub `CI` on current `main` `c9704b88` | Green | Success | pass |
| `git status --short --branch` | Clean and current | `## main...origin/main` | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Rollback safety exists via `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.git/codex-backups/merge-all-20260713T235354Z`, which contains ref bundles and dirty-state snapshots captured before mutation.
- Main contains a large integration range. If a regression is found, use the backup bundle plus merge commits (`dd408c9f`, `b1a7c5f8`, `f75c5c87`, `23ce44ec`, `d4982c52`) to isolate or revert the specific slice.
- PR #133 is intentionally not part of current `main`. Its active branch should be reviewed/merged independently rather than being folded into this session-log commit.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not delete `.claude/worktrees/canonical-entity-resolution-ea34c0` because it is the worktree for open PR #133 and is unmerged.
- Did not move old top-level `docs/plans/` files because the save-to-md maintenance pass did not prove they were clearly complete.
- Did not rewrite stale docs broadly because the session-log task is documentation capture, and the active PR #133 already carries many graph docs changes.
- Did not use a raw force-push or destructive git cleanup at any point.

## Open Questions

- The injected Claude transcript path points to a July 9 Claude session; the current Codex thread transcript path was not observed.
- The old files under `docs/plans/` may be complete, stale, or still intentionally open; this pass did not establish enough evidence to move them.
- PR #133 is open and green at its latest SHA, but review decision was empty when checked.

## Next Steps

- Review and merge or otherwise close PR #133: `gh pr view 133 --web` or `gh pr checks 133 --watch`.
- If desired, perform a dedicated `docs/plans/` triage pass for the three old top-level plans.
- Keep the backup directory until the merged `main` has run long enough in production that rollback confidence is no longer needed.
