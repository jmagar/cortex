# P1/P2 bead accuracy & relevancy audit

## User Request
"Audit the accuracy / relevancy of all of these beads and update the beads accordingly" — starting from the open P1 list, then (after the P1 pass) extended to all open P2 beads. Side requests during the session: list open P0/P1/P2; close `ad04` and `vy59`; rename the bead prefix (later retracted — "just leave it").

## Session Overview
Audited every open P1 (10) and P2 (47) bead against the current contracts, schema, source, and git history. Closed 5 beads whose work was already shipped or whose premise was obsolete, annotated 15 with evidence-backed accuracy/scope corrections, and left ~36 as accurate-and-unstarted. Surfaced systemic rebrand drift (`syslog-mcp` → `cortex`) and several contract-internal contradictions. A proposed prefix rename was investigated and rejected as destructive; the user chose to leave the prefix. All bead changes pushed to the Dolt remote.

## Sequence of Events
1. Answered branch/worktree query (clean `main` at the time), then corrected the record after discovering a mid-session checkout to a feature branch.
2. Listed open P0 (none), P1 (10), P2 (47) beads.
3. P1 pass: read all 10 P1 beads + parent epics in full; verified referenced contract/spec docs exist; greps proved zero agent-mode/WS/probe code exists while V1 heartbeat shipped.
4. Tested drift premises against contracts; closed `yab3` (8/8 children done); added audit comments to `9wc3`, `9wc3.1`, `m0ep.1`. Pushed to Dolt.
5. P2 pass: dispatched 7 parallel investigator subagents (one per subsystem cluster), each returning evidence-backed verdicts.
6. Adjudicated verdicts; verified the two DONE claims and the subprotocol drift directly before mutating; closed `iein` + `ze8m`; added 13 scope/drift notes. Pushed to Dolt.
7. Closed `ad04` (obsolete) and `vy59` (resolved-by-rejection) per user.
8. Prefix rename: dry-run revealed a dual-prefix DB and that `--repair` regenerates all IDs into random hashes; recommended against it; user chose to leave the prefix.
9. Dolt server briefly went unreachable mid-session, then recovered; pending closes re-confirmed and pushed.

## Key Findings
- **`yab3` epic was stale-open**: bd reported 8/8 children complete (100%, incl. `yab3.7` docs refresh) yet the epic stayed open. Closed.
- **Agent-mode initiative is 0% implemented**: no `agents` table, no `/ws/agent` route, no `logs.push` handler, no probe registry in `src/`. The four epics (`9wc3`/`gg6z`/`ihb9`/`m0ep`) are accurate but unstarted; all referenced contracts (`docs/contracts/agent-protocol.md`, `db-additions.sql`, `probe-trait.rs`, the two specs) exist and the `agents` schema AC matches `db-additions.sql:63` column-for-column.
- **Two perf beads already shipped**: `iein` (get_stats skips FTS phantom-count by default, `src/db/queries.rs:1802`/`1826`, commit bb41c69) and `ze8m` (`ingest_rate` uses `get_storage_metrics`+`exceeds_trigger`, not `get_stats`, `src/app/service.rs:1848`).
- **`ad04` premise obsolete**: `src/app/os_adapter.rs:80-150` — both `run_command`/`probe_command` now call `apply_dbus_env` up-front with no retry path; the asymmetry the bug describes cannot occur.
- **`vy59` defect fixed**: `src/config.rs:1080-1086` hard-rejects non-empty `allowed_emails` in OAuth mode; the silent-ignore is gone (multi-user enforcement remains a separate unbuilt feature).
- **Live drift confirmed**: `m0ep.1` schedule.set (probe-registry-design.md:123) vs config.update (agent-protocol.md §4.8, method list line 742) — genuinely contradictory; plus a `Probe` trait signature contradiction between `probe-trait.rs` and `probe-registry-design.md §2`.
- **Rebrand drift**: WS subprotocol is `cortex.v1` in `agent-protocol.md` but `syslog-mcp.v1` in the gg6z epic text; env var `SYSLOG_MCP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` should be `CORTEX_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` (`o7yf`); `ki8x` file moved `src/syslog/writer.rs` → `src/receiver/writer.rs`; bead prefix still `syslog-mcp-`.
- **Contract doc drift**: `docs/contracts/log-row-shape.md:32` claims `received_at` is INTEGER epoch-ms but the live schema is TEXT (`d9s8`).
- **`cxih` actively in progress**: fleet_state + correlate_state work was being committed on this branch during the session (9bd3874 cxih.3, 918a47a cxih.4, plus kmib.4/kmib.5 in 31e8771/16473c3). Left its children for the owning session.

## Technical Decisions
- **Adjudicate, don't rubber-stamp**: subagents returned provisional verdicts; the parent verified all DONE/close decisions and the subprotocol drift directly with greps before any close.
- **Annotate over rewrite**: for drifted/narrowed beads, added dated audit comments rather than editing AC text, preserving original intent as historical record.
- **Accurate-and-unchanged is valid**: ~36 beads were left untouched rather than manufacturing edits.
- **Relevancy is the user's call**: the agent-mode initiative disposition was surfaced (kept as-is per user), not decided unilaterally.
- **Rejected the prefix rename**: `bd rename-prefix --repair` regenerates suffixes into random hashes (`syslog-mcp-llto.1 → cortex-94878fc6`) and flattens the epic/child hierarchy across 968 issues — strictly worse than the cosmetic mismatch. User agreed to leave it.

| status | path | previous path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|

No source files were modified by this session. The dirty file `src/cli/http_client_tests.rs` belongs to the concurrent PR #60 work, not this session, and was deliberately left untouched.

## Beads Activity
**Closed (5):**
- `syslog-mcp-yab3` (P1 epic) — transport-boundary refactor: 8/8 children done, AC met.
- `syslog-mcp-iein` (P2) — stats phantom FTS counting already gated (bb41c69).
- `syslog-mcp-ze8m` (P2) — ingest_rate already decoupled from get_stats (bb41c69).
- `syslog-mcp-ad04` (P2 bug) — obsolete: D-Bus retry asymmetry no longer exists.
- `syslog-mcp-vy59` (P2 bug) — resolved-by-rejection: allowed_emails now hard-rejected in OAuth mode.

**Commented / annotated (15):**
- P1: `9wc3` (token-name rebrand staleness; schema AC matches contract), `9wc3.1` (token-path drift largely already reconciled; residual naming + host_id-vs-V1), `m0ep.1` (drift still live + added Probe-trait contradiction).
- P2: `ki8x` (path move + bug still real), `o7yf` (env-var rename, impl open), `dr05` (default-lookback done; bucket cap remains), `bw7z` (default-range done; numeric column remains), `jpwd` (pagination done; EXPLAIN/test remains), `6gj1` (source_ips tests done; apps test remains), `ivgj` (bin/syslog stale 0.27.1), `d9s8` (numeric-column gap + contract doc drift), `gg6z` (subprotocol cortex.v1 drift), `cxih` (active on branch; children left for owning session).

**Left unchanged (accurate & unstarted):** the agent-mode children (`9wc3.2/.3/.4`, `gg6z.1/.2/.3`, `ihb9`/`.1/.2/.3`, `m0ep`/`.2/.3/.4`), the Aurora-CLI-tokens epic (`6bwx`+5 children), the MCP-Apps widget (`yi66`+2), API pollers (`awvr`), `kmib.4/.5`, and confirmed-real perf/test work (`kbzg`, `8f6q`, `2wmw`, `dzoi`, `g3dp`, `xjz1`, `lerh`, `l3xk`, `0fm0`, `v8nk`, `q9kx`, `6gj1`).

All bead changes were pushed to the Dolt remote (`bd dolt push` — "Push complete").

## Repository Maintenance
- **Plans**: Inspected `docs/plans/` (5 files, all pre-dating this session — unifi-cef, rmcp-stdio, rmcp-streamable-http, mnemo-feature-port, compose-lifecycle-cli). None are this session's work and completion could not be safely verified, so **none moved**; `docs/plans/complete/` not created. No-op by design.
- **Beads**: Full pass completed (5 closed, 15 annotated, pushed). The Dolt server (`100.75.111.118:3311`) went unreachable briefly mid-session (circuit breaker open) then recovered; the `ad04`/`vy59` closes were re-confirmed CLOSED and re-pushed after recovery.
- **Worktrees/branches**: One worktree only (`/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex`). Branches: `main` (e8f69ae) and the active PR #60 branch `feat/heartbeat-state-parity-and-incident-findings` (aba264f). **No cleanup** — the feature branch is an active PR with uncommitted WIP owned by a concurrent session.
- **Stale docs**: Found `docs/contracts/log-row-shape.md:32` (INTEGER vs TEXT) and the subprotocol / Probe-trait contradictions. **Not edited** — recorded on the relevant beads as follow-ups instead, to avoid modifying docs on a concurrent agent's PR branch.
- **Transparency**: The git commit/push of this session file was deliberately **held** — see Risks and Open Questions.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Shell (Bash)**: git (status/branch/reflog/log/show), `rg`/`find` codebase recon, `bd` reads/closes/comments/push, `python3` for JSON parsing. Issues: `bd`'s auto-export emitted repeated `git add failed: exit status 128` warnings (benign — Dolt is source of truth); one `python3 json.load` failed on truncated `bd list --json` output (worked around with grep).
- **Skills**: `beads:beads` (workflow context); `vibin:save-to-md` (this artifact).
- **Subagents**: 7 parallel `general-purpose` investigators (6 on sonnet, 1 default) for the P2 audit, one per subsystem cluster; all returned structured evidence and were adjudicated by the parent.
- **advisor**: consulted once after P1 orientation to sharpen the audit approach before mutating beads.
- **MCP**: none used for the audit. (Telegram MCP disconnected mid-session per ambient notice; not used.)

## Commands Executed
| command | result |
|---|---|
| `git branch -a && git worktree list && git status -sb` | initially clean `main`; later on feature branch with WIP |
| `git reflog -8 --date=iso` | confirmed checkout main→feature at 2026-05-31 11:12 |
| `bd list --status=open --priority=0/1/2 --limit 0` | P0: 0, P1: 10, P2: 47 |
| `bd show <ids> --long` | full P1 bead/epic details |
| `bd close syslog-mcp-{yab3,iein,ze8m,ad04,vy59} --reason ...` | 5 closes succeeded |
| `bd comment syslog-mcp-<id> "AUDIT 2026-05-31: ..."` | 15 comments added |
| `bd dolt push` | "Push complete" (after one transient outage + retry) |
| `bd rename-prefix cortex- --repair --dry-run` | revealed 968 issues, random-hash regeneration → rejected |

## Errors Encountered
- **`git add: exit status 128`** (repeated, from `bd` auto-export of JSONL into git): root cause — the optional JSONL git-export colliding with the concurrent feature branch state; impact — none (Dolt is the canonical store). Left as-is.
- **Dolt server unreachable** (`dial tcp 100.75.111.118:3311: i/o timeout`, circuit breaker open): root cause — external homelab host blip; resolution — waited; server recovered; pending `ad04`/`vy59` closes re-confirmed and pushed.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)
| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Open bead backlog | 10 P1 + 47 P2, several stale/done/obsolete | 9 P1 + 45 P2; 5 stale/done closed, 15 annotated with current evidence |
| `yab3`/`iein`/`ze8m`/`ad04`/`vy59` | open | closed with reasons |
| Bead prefix | `syslog-mcp-` | unchanged (rename rejected as destructive) |

## Verification Evidence
| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rg "fn get_stats" src/db/queries.rs` | get_stats delegates, FTS gated | queries.rs:1802 → get_stats_with_options(...,false); 1826 gated | pass |
| `ingest_rate` body grep | no get_stats call | uses get_storage_metrics + exceeds_trigger (service.rs:1848) | pass |
| `rg "cortex.v1\|syslog-mcp.v1" agent-protocol.md` | contract uses cortex.v1 | cortex.v1 at lines 10/21/730-737 | pass |
| `bd show ad04/vy59` | CLOSED | CLOSED | pass |
| `bd dolt push` | Push complete | Push complete | pass |

## Risks and Rollback
- **Session file not committed/pushed**: held deliberately to avoid appending an unrelated docs commit to a concurrent agent's open PR #60 branch and entangling with its uncommitted WIP. The file is durable on disk; rollback = delete the file. To publish, commit path-limited on a dedicated branch off `main` (see Next Steps).
- **Bead closes**: reversible via `bd reopen <id>`; each close carries a dated reason citing the evidence.

## Decisions Not Taken
- **Prefix rename via `--repair`**: rejected — regenerates 968 IDs into random hashes and flattens hierarchy.
- **Editing contract docs / moving plans**: deferred — would modify a concurrent agent's PR branch; recorded as bead follow-ups instead.
- **Reprioritizing/deferring the agent-mode epics**: not done — user chose "keep as-is".

## References
- PR #60: https://github.com/jmagar/cortex/pull/60
- Contracts: `docs/contracts/agent-protocol.md`, `db-additions.sql`, `probe-trait.rs`, `log-row-shape.md`, `runtime-lifecycle.md`
- Specs: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-agent-mode-design.md`, `2026-05-16-probe-registry-design.md`

## Open Questions
- How should this session log be published given the working tree is on PR #60's branch? (Hold, dedicated docs branch off `main`, or commit onto the feature branch?)
- `ivgj`: should `just build-plugin` be run to refresh the stale `bin/syslog` (0.27.1 vs built 0.36.1)? Not done here (would modify the concurrent PR branch).

## Next Steps
- **Immediate**: decide how to land this session file (recommended: `git checkout -b docs/session-2026-05-31 main` then path-limited commit + push, leaving PR #60 untouched).
- **Unblocked bead follow-ups**: reconcile the two contract contradictions on `m0ep.1` (schedule.set vs config.update; Probe-trait signature) before any probe-registry implementation; fix the `received_at` INTEGER-vs-TEXT claim in `log-row-shape.md` (`d9s8`); refresh `bin/syslog` for `ivgj`.
- **Owned by the concurrent session**: close `cxih.3`/`cxih.4` (and the `cxih` epic) once docs/contracts parity is confirmed — work already committed on this branch.
- **Optional**: if a `cortex-` prefix is ever truly wanted with readable suffixes, scope an export → JSONL ID-transform → re-import path (not the built-in `rename-prefix`).
