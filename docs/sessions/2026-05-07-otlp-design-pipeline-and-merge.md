# Session: OTLP design pipeline → implementation → reviews → merge

## User Request

Run `/lavra-design @docs/expansion.md` end-to-end, then in a worktree run `/lavra-work syslog-mcp-6uoy` to implement the entire epic without stopping, create a PR, and run `lavra-review`, `simplify`, `pr-review-toolkit`, and `gh-address-comments`.

## Session Overview

Took the syslog-mcp expansion brief from `docs/expansion.md` through a full lavra design pipeline (brainstorm → plan → 5-agent research → revise → CEO review → 4-agent engineering review → lock), then implemented Phases 1–2 (Rust) and shipped Phases 3–5 as deploy artifacts in a single PR. Ran four review skills (lavra-review, simplify, pr-review-toolkit, gh-address-comments) and addressed 18 of 18 review threads from CodeRabbit / Codex / Copilot. Fixed two CI failures caused by the earlier plugin restructure. PR #13 merged into main as commit `e91b46e`. Final state: OTLP/HTTP receiver, ingest enrichment, tag-based retention, and rsyslog/OTel deploy artifacts all in main.

Earlier in the session also fixed an unrelated runtime crash (`SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS_FILE` missing-file hard-fail), shipping that as 0.10.2 first.

## Sequence of Events

1. Reviewed `docs/expansion.md` (full-fleet log ingest brief) and ran lavra-design pipeline:
   - Brainstorm: epic `syslog-mcp-6uoy` + 5 phase beads
   - Plan: detail enriched, dependencies wired (`.2 → .1`, `.5 → .1`)
   - Research: 5 agents (best-practices, framework-docs, security, performance, data-integrity) returned ~30 findings; revised the plan to lock composite index, body limits, Bearer auth, LazyLock regex
   - CEO review: HOLD SCOPE; resolved deployment mechanism (manual SSH), OTLP observability (health counters + INFO log), scrubbing knob, OTel endpoint hard-coded to dookie:3100
   - Engineering review: 4 agents (architecture, simplicity, security, performance) ran in parallel
   - Final lock: epic + 5 child bead descriptions saturated with implementation detail
2. Worktree created (`feat/otlp-expansion`), `.env` and `config.toml` copied in
3. Phase 1 (OTLP HTTP receiver): added `opentelemetry-proto = 0.31` + `prost = 0.14`, created `src/otlp.rs` with logs/metrics/traces handlers, wired through `runtime.rs` and `main.rs`, extended `/health`. 15 unit tests added.
4. Phase 2 (enrichment + retention): added `regex` dep, created `src/syslog/enrichment.rs` with LazyLock regex, source-IP gating, secret scrubbing; added Migration v3 composite index in `src/db/pool.rs`; added `purge_by_tag_window` to `src/db/maintenance.rs`; modified `purge_old_logs` for severity exemption; instrumented `enforce_storage_budget`. 17 unit tests added.
5. Phases 3–5 (deploy artifacts): created `deploy/rsyslog/*.conf`, `deploy/otel/*.example.{json,toml}`, `deploy/README.md` runbook.
6. Bumped to 0.11.0, committed, pushed, opened PR #13.
7. Ran lavra-review (4 agents) → applied bearer-auth dedup, Cow scrub optimisation, PEM body redaction, severity match merge, startup WARN. Committed and pushed.
8. Ran codebase-cleanup:refactor-clean → applied `ADGUARD_RETENTION_TAGS` const + loop simplification.
9. Ran pr-review-toolkit (4 agents: tests, silent-failure, types, comments) → fixed retention `?` short-circuit (CRITICAL — one tag failure was aborting the whole cycle), added auth-failure logging, AdGuardQuery `rename_all = "PascalCase"`, comment corrections. Committed.
10. Ran gh-address-comments → 18 review threads from CodeRabbit/Codex/Copilot. Applied OTLP partial-enqueue pre-flight (3 reviewers concurred, P1), `try_send` Closed→500 vs Full→503 differentiation, `source_ip` prefix-collision fix (Critical), README link fix, `fts_merge_pages` range validation, typo/path fixes. Resolved 14 threads in this round.
11. User requested the 4 deferred nits be implemented; created bead `syslog-mcp-pmdl`, then implemented all four (OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS doc, imjournal rate-limit rationale, 4 purge_by_tag_window unit tests, retention tick deleted-counts logging).
12. CI failed on `build-and-push` and `MCP Integration Tests` — Dockerfile path issue from earlier restructure (commit `89b7221` moved Dockerfile to `config/Dockerfile`). Fixed `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` and `tests/test_live.sh`.
13. User merged PR #13. Pulled into main locally.
14. Earlier in session (before the OTLP work): fixed `SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS_FILE` missing-file hard-fail bug, shipped as 0.10.2 commit `89b7221` (the same restructure commit that moved Dockerfile).

## Key Findings

- `LogBatchEntry` (`src/db/models.rs`) uses named fields — `hostname`, `severity`, `app_name`, `source_ip`, `docker_checkpoint`, etc. Every new ingest source has to know the storage schema.
- FTS5 DELETE/UPDATE triggers were intentionally dropped in Migration 1 to avoid write-lock contention during bulk deletes; `fts_incremental_merge` is mandatory after any tag-based purge or chunk delete (`src/db/maintenance.rs`).
- Severity strings in the schema are exactly `emerg|alert|crit|err|warning|notice|info|debug` — confirmed against `SEVERITY_LEVELS` in `src/db/queries.rs`.
- `opentelemetry-proto = 0.31` requires `default-features = false` to avoid pulling full gRPC; `gen-tonic-messages` despite the name does NOT pull `tonic` transport.
- `prost = 0.14` is the correct version for `opentelemetry-proto = 0.31` (initial guess at 0.13 produced a `Message::decode` trait mismatch).
- The `bearer_token` / `token_matches` pair was triplicated identically in `src/otlp.rs`, `src/mcp/routes.rs`, `src/api.rs` — extracted to `src/auth.rs` to remove drift risk for security code.
- `source_ip_matches` plain `starts_with` allowed `10.0.0.1` config to match attacker at `10.0.0.10` — fixed to require either trailing-dot subnet prefix OR exact IP match (`src/syslog/enrichment.rs`).
- `scrub_secrets` was `to_string()`-ing once per pattern (9 allocations per AI message even when nothing matched) — switched to `Cow<str>` threading.
- PEM regex matched only the BEGIN line, leaving the key body verbatim and FTS5-indexed — fixed to `(?s)` whole-block match.
- Tag-window purge `?` was aborting the entire retention cycle on one transient SQLITE_BUSY (would have stalled all retention for an hour) — switched to per-tag error logging, continue.
- OTLP `build_entries` allocated all records before the `try_send` loop, allowing partial-accept duplication on retry — added pre-flight `IngestTx::capacity()` check that rejects whole request before any send.
- `SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS_FILE` was hard-failing on missing file even though it's optional config — fixed in `src/config.rs` to log a warning and continue (shipped as 0.10.2 separately).
- Dockerfile path: the plugin restructure (0.10.2) moved `Dockerfile` to `config/Dockerfile`, which broke both `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` and `tests/test_live.sh` — required `file: config/Dockerfile` and `-f config/Dockerfile` respectively.

## Technical Decisions

- **`/v1/traces` returns 404**: Both architecture and simplicity agents recommended deferring. FTS5 cannot meaningfully query hex trace IDs, span semantics (parent_span_id, duration_ns, status_code) are lost in flat rows. Defer until a real trace backend exists.
- **Optional Bearer auth shared with MCP**: User chose shared `SYSLOG_MCP_TOKEN` over separate `SYSLOG_MCP_INGEST_TOKEN` (homelab risk accepted). Token literal added to scrubber so a leaked copy in tool output gets redacted before FTS5 indexes it.
- **Source-IP gating defaults**: `None`/empty → apply to all matching `app_name` (legacy default). Subnet match requires trailing dot. Exact-host match otherwise.
- **`OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1` retained**: Risk accepted — file contents (SSH keys, .env) get ingested. `SYSLOG_MCP_SCRUB_PROMPTS=true` is the defense-in-depth control, not a compliance guarantee.
- **Tag-based retention runs BEFORE global purge**: Avoids SQLite write-lock contention from concurrent chunked DELETEs; consolidates FTS merge work.
- **Severity-exempt retention with documented coupling**: `err+` rows skip time-based purge; `enforce_storage_budget` still deletes them under disk pressure with a `tracing::warn!` so operators are not surprised.
- **`fts_incremental_merge` M=0 default, configurable**: Forces unconditional merge after bulk deletes (M=250 may be a no-op without concurrent inserts). Made configurable via `SYSLOG_MCP_FTS_MERGE_PAGES` so rollback is config-only, not binary.
- **No staged rollout / no shart migration**: User overrode the expansion.md plan — implement all phases at once, syslog-mcp stays on `dookie`.
- **CRITICAL fix taken from 3 reviewers concurring (Codex P1 + CodeRabbit Major + Copilot)**: OTLP partial-enqueue. Pre-flight `IngestTx::capacity()` check rejects whole batch with 503 BEFORE any try_send, eliminating the duplicate-on-retry path.

## Errors Encountered

- **prost trait mismatch on first compile** — `opentelemetry-proto = 0.31` resolved `prost = 0.14` transitively but I declared `prost = "0.13"` directly. `Message::decode` was the wrong trait. Fix: bumped Cargo.toml to `prost = "0.14"`.
- **Clippy `result_large_err` on `IngestTx::try_send`** — `TrySendError<LogBatchEntry>` carries the entry by value. Fix: introduced `TrySendErr { Full, Closed }` enum, dropping the entry on backpressure (acceptable contract).
- **Test failures from `AppState` field addition** — `routes_tests.rs`, `tools_tests.rs`, `rmcp_server_tests.rs` all construct `AppState` literals. Updated each to include `otlp_counters: Arc::new(OtlpCounters::default())`.
- **`tokio::sync::mpsc::channel` requires runtime** — auth tests in `otlp_tests.rs` panicked with "no reactor running". Fix: added `IngestTx::from_sender_for_test` so the auth helper can build an `IngestTx` from a raw channel without spawning the writer.
- **Pre-commit hook `validate-skills` failed** — `Justfile:51` referenced the old `skills/syslog/SKILL.md` path; the plugin restructure moved it to `plugins/skills/syslog/SKILL.md`. Fixed inline.
- **CI `build-and-push` and `MCP Integration Tests` both failed with `failed to read dockerfile`** — Dockerfile is at `config/Dockerfile` after restructure. Fixed workflow + integration test script.
- **`bd create --tags` flag not supported** — wasted ~10 bead-create attempts with `--tags`. The actual flag is `--label`. Pivoted to single tracking bead instead of refiling.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Surface | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/logs` | did not exist | accepts OTLP protobuf, ingests records |
| `POST /v1/metrics` | did not exist | 200 + discard |
| `POST /v1/traces` | did not exist | 404 (deferred) |
| `GET /health` | `{"status":"ok"}` | + `otlp_logs_received`, `otlp_decode_errors` |
| Authelia logs | severity = config'd default | severity reclassified from `level=…` field |
| AdGuard logs | tag = `adguard-query` for everything | classified to `adguard-blocked`/`-allowed`/`-rewrite` |
| AI-source records | message stored verbatim | secret patterns + API token literal redacted |
| Tag retention | global `retention_days` only | `adguard-*` capped at 7 days regardless |
| Time-based purge | aged out all rows | excludes `severity ≥ err` |
| Storage enforce | silent disk-pressure deletes | `tracing::warn!` when deleting err+ rows |
| Maintenance schedule | hourly global purge | tag-window first, then global; sums + reports per-bucket counts |
| Missing `SYSLOG_DOCKER_HOSTS_FILE` | container crash loop | logs a warn, continues (0.10.2) |

## Risks and Rollback

- **Migration v3 startup window**: First boot on a 4.9M-row production DB will hold the SQLite write lock for 30–90s while building the composite index. `/health` will not respond and syslog UDP may drop during that window. Documented in `deploy/README.md` and CHANGELOG.
- **OTLP unauthenticated default**: Inherited the existing MCP trust model. Startup logs a `tracing::warn!` if bound on a non-loopback address with no token. To require auth, set `SYSLOG_MCP_TOKEN` and have OTel exporters send `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=Authorization=Bearer …`.
- **Secret scrubber is best-effort**: Documented in code and `deploy/otel/claude-code-settings.example.json`. Multi-line wraps and unfamiliar token formats can bypass it. Default-true so the safer behaviour is the default.
- **Rollback**: Revert the 0.11.0 release commit. `DROP INDEX idx_logs_app_name_received_at` reverses Migration v3 (tag purges become slower but still correct). OTLP routes simply disappear when the new binary is replaced; existing syslog ingest is unaffected.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Separate ingest/query tokens** — `SYSLOG_MCP_INGEST_TOKEN` distinct from `SYSLOG_MCP_TOKEN` was rejected by the user (homelab risk accepted).
- **`/v1/traces` span flattening** — both architecture and simplicity agents flagged this as architectural debt with no query story. Deferred to a real trace backend (Tempo/Jaeger) if one ever lands.
- **Move `fts_merge_pages` to `StorageConfig`** — type-design agent suggested it. Left in `EnrichmentConfigToml` for now since it ships in the same release as enrichment knobs; revisit if the config split causes confusion.
- **`OtlpCounters` accessor methods** — type-design agent recommended baking in `Ordering::Relaxed` to prevent caller drift. Deferred (small caller surface, low immediate risk).
- **Streaming bollard client split (bead `syslog-mcp-j38d.1`)** — explicit revert in commit `41d46b8` because bollard's timeout is header-only. Underlying issue solved instead via TCP keepalive (`9dba9de`) + idle-close handling (`390e983`).

## Open Questions

- A new epic `syslog-mcp-brt0` (Add OAuth 2.0 authentication via shared lab-auth crate) appeared with 8 P2 child beads while this session was running. Origin and intended scheduling are unclear — flagged but not investigated.
- The local working tree currently has uncommitted modifications in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs`, and `README.md` — all pre-existing WIP, unrelated to PR #13. Decision pending.
- `phantom_fts_rows` accumulation at AdGuard volumes (50k+/day) was flagged by the performance agent as borderline at the merge=500,20-iteration cap. Worth measuring in production before declaring "fine."

## Next Steps

**Started but not completed in this session**:
- Pull on `main` after merge: ✅ done. The OTLP work is fully in.

**Follow-on work (not yet started)**:
- Watch first 24h of OTLP traffic on `dookie` once Phase 5 (Claude/Codex OTel client config) deploys to confirm the receiver, scrubber, and retention behave under live volume.
- Manual deploy of Phases 3–5 (rsyslog drop-ins on dookie/squirts/steamy-wsl/vivobook-wsl, OTel client config edits) per `deploy/README.md` — operator task.
- Consider implementing the new `syslog-mcp-brt0` OAuth epic if/when it's prioritised.
- Decide what to do with the four uncommitted WIP files in the working tree.
- Optional simplifications surfaced by reviewers but not applied: drop `OtlpState::new` no-op constructor, consider folding `fts_merge_pages` into `StorageConfig`, add accessors on `OtlpCounters`.
