# Cortex runtime configuration audit

## User Request

Verify every Rust project's deployed `.env` and `config.toml` arrangement is complete and in the correct location.

## Session Overview

Cortex was confirmed to be an intentional env-only Docker deployment on tootie. Its live source is `/mnt/user/appdata/cortex/.env`; the local canonical copy was secured, and the repo-root dotenv was moved to the protected audit backup.

## Sequence of Events

1. Inspected Cortex config lookup and live tootie container mounts.
2. Verified the live appdata env and healthy container.
3. Secured the local canonical env and relocated the repo-root dotenv backup.

## Key Findings

- Cortex does not require a `config.toml` for the deployed Docker mode.
- Live runtime truth is on tootie, not the local checkout.

## Technical Decisions

- Did not create a misleading TOML file for an env-only runtime.
- Preserved the former repo dotenv at `/home/jmagar/.config-audit-backup/20260723T022512/repo-env-files/cortex.env`.

## Files Changed

| status | path | previous path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| renamed | `/home/jmagar/.config-audit-backup/20260723T022512/repo-env-files/cortex.env` | `./.env` | Remove secrets from repo root without deleting them | Backup mode `0600` |
| modified | `/home/jmagar/.cortex/.env` | — | Secure local canonical copy | Mode `0600` |
| created | `docs/sessions/2026-07-23-runtime-configuration-audit.md` | — | Repo-scoped session record | This file |

## Beads Activity

No bead activity observed for Cortex.

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: existing incomplete/ambiguous plans were left in place; completed plans were already under `docs/plans/complete`.
- Beads: read-only inspection.
- Worktrees/branches: fetched/pruned; local `main`'s pre-existing ahead commit was preserved.
- Stale docs: no deployed-path contradiction was changed in-repo.
- Cleanup: no source file was staged.

## Tools and Skills Used

- SSH, Docker inspection, file permission checks, Git maintenance, and `vibin:save-to-md`.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `ssh tootie docker inspect cortex` | Confirmed live mounts and healthy state |
| Canonical file matrix | Env present and private; config intentionally absent |

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Repo-root secret | Present | Relocated to protected backup |
| Live runtime | Healthy | Healthy, unchanged |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tootie container inspect | Healthy | Healthy | pass |
| Env-mode audit | No TOML required | Env-only confirmed | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

Restore the protected backup to the checkout only if an old repo-root workflow requires it; the live tootie deployment was not changed.

## Decisions Not Taken

- No `config.toml` was fabricated for an env-only deployment.

## Next Steps

- Continue treating `/mnt/user/appdata/cortex/.env` as runtime authority.
