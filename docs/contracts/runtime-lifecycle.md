# Runtime Lifecycle Contract (V1)

## 1. Purpose & status

Contract derived from `src/main.rs` (CLI mode dispatch, `serve_mcp`, `shutdown_signal`), `src/runtime.rs` (`RuntimeCore`, `MaintenanceHandles`, `build_auth_policy`), `src/mcp/routes.rs::health`, and `src/observability.rs::RuntimeObservabilitySnapshot`. It pins the operator-visible process contract: which CLI mode does what, which signals are honored, how the server shuts down, the shape of `/health`, and the exit-code matrix.

Anyone wiring `syslog-mcp` into `systemd`, Docker, Kubernetes, or a Compose-managed deployment should be able to write correct probes, restart policies, and graceful-stop timeouts from this document alone.

Companion contracts: `docs/contracts/config-schema.md` (knobs that drive these modes), `docs/contracts/data-layout.md` (filesystem state the process owns).

## 2. Process modes (from `Mode::parse` in `src/main.rs`)

| Invocation | Mode | Starts | Skips | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `syslog` (no args) or `syslog serve mcp` | **ServeMcp** | UDP+TCP syslog listeners, batch writer, retention task, storage-budget task, docker-ingest tasks (when enabled), HTTP MCP server on `[mcp].port`, OTLP `/v1/logs` mount, optional non-MCP `/api` mount | — | Production daemon — the one host per fleet that ingests and stores logs. |
| `syslog mcp` | **StdioMcp** | RMCP stdio transport bound to the same SQLite store (read-mostly query path) | All listeners; no HTTP port is bound; auth policy is forced to `LoopbackDev` (process isolation is the trust boundary) | Wiring `syslog-mcp` into an MCP client (Claude Code plugin, Codex) on a query-only client host. |
| `syslog setup [check\|repair\|doctor\|ai-index-timer …]` | **Setup** | One-shot setup phases (write `~/.syslog-mcp/.env`, render compose, install systemd timers, etc.) | Never binds listeners; never starts maintenance tasks | First-run install, plugin hook reruns, dev-mode rewires. |
| `syslog doctor [binary] [--json]` | **Doctor** | One-shot health audit (setup, compose, binary, AI transcripts) | Never binds listeners | Diagnostics / smoke checks. |
| `syslog search\|tail\|errors\|hosts\|sessions\|ai\|correlate\|stats\|db\|compose` | **Cli** | Single query or maintenance operation against the SQLite store via `RuntimeCore::load_query_only` | Never binds the syslog/HTTP listeners; never spawns maintenance tasks | Operator queries on the box; scripting. |
| `syslog --version` / `--help` | Version/Help | Print and exit | Everything | Banner. |

Default tracing filter per mode is set by `Mode::default_log_filter`: `info` for `ServeMcp`, `warn` for stdio/setup/doctor, `error` for one-shot CLI queries. `RUST_LOG` overrides.

**ServeMcp startup ordering** (`src/main.rs::serve_mcp`):

1. `RuntimeCore::load()` → `Config::load()` runs all §6 validations; on failure: `anyhow::bail!` → exit 1.
2. `db::init_pool` → opens SQLite, applies schema, enables WAL; on failure: exit 2 (anyhow bubble).
3. Initial storage-budget enforcement (when configured).
4. `start_writer_from_syslog_config` → spawns the batch writer.
5. `build_auth_policy` → fails fast on OAuth-init errors; tightens auth file perms to 0600.
6. `start_syslog().await` → binds UDP + TCP listeners (`SO_REUSEADDR` per Tokio defaults).
7. `spawn_maintenance_tasks()` → retention + storage + docker-ingest tasks.
8. Merge `mcp::router`, optional `/api`, and `runtime.otlp_router()` → final `axum::Router`.
9. `TcpListener::bind(mcp_bind)` → bind the MCP HTTP port; on failure: exit 3 (bind error).
10. `axum::serve(...).with_graceful_shutdown(shutdown_signal())` → run until SIGINT/SIGTERM.

Any failure before step 9 prevents the HTTP port from opening, so health probes can rely on `/health` being a strong "all listeners are up" indicator.

## 3. Signal handling

Signal handler installed by `src/main.rs::shutdown_signal`. Unix-only signals are guarded by `#[cfg(unix)]`.

| Signal | Number | V1 behavior | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIGINT`  | 2  | Graceful shutdown | `ctrl_c` future in `shutdown_signal`. Exit 130 per convention. |
| `SIGTERM` | 15 | Graceful shutdown | `SignalKind::terminate()` future. Identical handling to SIGINT. Exit 143. |
| `SIGHUP`  | 1  | **No-op (not installed).** The default-disposition `SIGHUP` terminates the process. There is no config-reload semantics. | Unix daemon convention says SIGHUP reloads config; we **do not** support that. Adding it later is a feature, not an expectation. |
| `SIGUSR1` | 10 | Unused | Default disposition (terminate). Reserved; do not rely on. |
| `SIGUSR2` | 12 | Unused | Same. |
| `SIGPIPE` | 13 | Handled by Tokio/axum | We do not crash on broken-pipe writes. |
| `SIGQUIT` | 3  | Default (core dump) | Use SIGINT/SIGTERM for clean stops. |
| `SIGKILL` | 9  | Unblockable | Operator-of-last-resort; will leave WAL files behind (recovered on next start). |

Windows: only `ctrl_c` is wired; `terminate` is `pending::<()>()`.

## 4. Graceful shutdown sequence (normative)

Triggered by SIGINT or SIGTERM. Order locked by `axum::serve(...).with_graceful_shutdown(...)` plus the `Drop` implementations on `MaintenanceHandles` and `RuntimeCore`.

1. **Stop accepting new HTTP connections.** axum's graceful-shutdown future flips; new TCP accepts on `mcp.port` are refused. In-flight HTTP requests are allowed to finish.
2. **Drain in-flight requests.** axum waits for outstanding handlers to return.
3. **Drop `MaintenanceHandles`** (via `_maintenance: MaintenanceHandles` going out of scope when `serve_mcp` returns). Its `Drop` impl calls `JoinHandle::abort()` on the retention task, the storage-budget task, and each docker-ingest task. The aborted tasks finish their current `await` and return.
4. **UDP/TCP syslog listeners** stop reading once the runtime begins teardown. There is **no explicit drain step** for in-flight syslog packets in V1 — packets already in the kernel UDP socket buffer are dropped, and partial TCP lines are abandoned. Packets that already crossed the `mpsc` into the writer are flushed by step 5.
5. **Writer drain.** The batch writer is not explicitly `await`ed during shutdown — it lives in a `tokio::spawn` rooted in `RuntimeCore` and is dropped when the runtime exits. Items already in its `mpsc` ring are flushed only if the writer's current loop iteration completes before the Tokio runtime tears down. **Loss window**: anything in the channel since the most recent commit (≤ `[syslog].batch_size` rows, ≤ `[syslog].flush_interval` ms old) may be lost on hard shutdown.
6. **DB pool close.** The `Arc<DbPool>` is dropped when `RuntimeCore` drops. SQLx closes connections; SQLite's WAL is left intact (no explicit `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` call in V1).
7. **Process exit.** `tokio::main` returns `Ok(())`; the process exits 0.

**Shutdown deadline.** There is **no explicit shutdown timeout knob in V1** (`shutdown_timeout_secs` is **not** a `Config` field; this is an open question — see §9). The orchestrator's stop-timeout governs how long the kernel will wait before promoting SIGTERM to SIGKILL. **Operators must set Docker `stop_grace_period: 30s` (or larger) in compose** — the default 10 s is enough for healthy shutdowns at homelab volumes but provides no buffer if the writer is mid-flush of a big batch. For systemd, set `TimeoutStopSec=30s` on the unit.

**WAL safety.** Because SQLite is configured with WAL mode (`storage.wal_mode = true`), abrupt SIGKILL or power loss does **not** corrupt the database. On next start SQLite replays WAL automatically. The only loss is the in-memory batch since the most recent transaction commit (≤ `batch_size` rows).

## 5. Healthcheck contract: `GET /health`

Implemented in `src/mcp/routes.rs::health`. Mounted on the MCP HTTP port outside the auth-gated router so Docker / SWAG / Prometheus can hit it unauthenticated.

### Status semantics (V1)

| HTTP status | Meaning | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Process is up, listeners are bound, DB connectivity verified by `service.health_check().await`. | None. |
| `5xx` (currently `500 Internal Server Error`) | DB connectivity failed. The container/unit should be restarted. | Restart and inspect logs. |

V1 **does not** distinguish liveness from readiness: there is no `503` "still warming up" state. The HTTP server only binds (`TcpListener::bind`) after listener bring-up and maintenance-task spawn, so by the time `/health` is reachable, the process is fully live and ready. Adding a readiness probe shape is deferred to V2.

### Body shape (downstream-stable contract)

Body is JSON. **Field additions are always allowed** (additive minor change); renames or removals are a contract break and require a major version bump. The exact field set comes from `src/observability.rs::RuntimeObservabilitySnapshot` (plus the `status` envelope and OTLP counters).

```jsonc

    // Last-event timestamps (RFC3339 millis UTC, nullable)
    "last_ingest_at":               "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" | null,
    "last_write_at":                "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" | null,
    "last_error_at":                "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" | null,
    "last_docker_ingest_event_at":  "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" | null,
    "last_docker_ingest_log_at":    "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" | null,
    "last_docker_ingest_error_at":  "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ" | null
  }
  // Future (planned, not in V1):
  //   "agents": { "total": ..., "active": ..., "revoked": ... }   // Epic A
  //   "pollers": { "<name>": { "last_poll_at": ..., "errors": ... } }  // Epic C
  //   "notifications": { "rules_active": ..., "deliveries": ... }  // Epic E
}
```

Field groupings (Prometheus / Grafana consumers may rely on these prefixes):

- `syslog_udp_*`, `syslog_tcp_*` — listener counters.
- `docker_ingest_*` — remote Docker socket-proxy ingestion.
- `ingest_*` — channel/queue state between listeners and writer.
- `writer_*` — batch writer + storage-budget interaction.
- `otlp_*` — OTLP `/v1/logs` receiver counters (top-level, not under `ingest`).

**Compatibility rule.** Removing or renaming any field listed above is a major-version break. Adding new fields under `ingest`, adding top-level keys (e.g. `agents`, `pollers`), or extending grouped counters is additive and minor.

### Docker compose example

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` already wires this:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -sf http://localhost:3100/health || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 10s
```

`start_period: 10s` covers the gap between container start and `axum::serve` accepting connections; tune up if your host is slow to start SQLite under contention.

## 6. Exit codes

| Code | Cause | Reachable from |
|---|---|---|
| `0`   | Graceful shutdown, or any one-shot CLI/setup/doctor command that completed successfully. | All modes. |
| `1`   | Config error: any `validate_*` failure in `src/config.rs`, missing required OAuth fields, blank tokens, parent-of-`SYSLOG_MCP_DB_PATH` missing, unknown CLI flag, unknown setup subcommand. | `anyhow::bail!` from `Config::load` or `Mode::parse`. |
| `2`   | DB initialization failure: `db::init_pool` cannot open the SQLite file, cannot apply schema migrations, or cannot enable WAL. | `serve_mcp`, `RuntimeCore::load*`. |
| `3`   | Bind error: `TcpListener::bind(mcp_bind)` failed (port in use, address not configured). Also covers UDP/TCP syslog bind failures via `start_syslog`. | `serve_mcp`. |
| `130` | `SIGINT` (Unix convention: `128 + 2`). | ServeMcp graceful shutdown via Ctrl-C. |
| `143` | `SIGTERM` (Unix convention: `128 + 15`). | ServeMcp graceful shutdown via orchestrator. |
| other (typically `101`) | Uncaught panic. Treat as crash; container/unit should restart. | Any mode. |

**Note**: V1 does not currently `std::process::exit(N)` to distinguish (1)/(2)/(3) — they all surface as `Err` from `tokio::main`, which Rust maps to a generic non-zero exit (commonly `1`). The matrix above is the **intended** semantics and the target for a planned `ExitCode` cleanup. Operators writing systemd `Restart=` policies should treat any non-zero, non-{130,143} code as a fatal startup error for now.

## 7. Startup invariants (operator preconditions)

Operators must satisfy these before launching `syslog serve mcp`. Failing any produces a startup error per §6.

1. **DB path is writable by the runtime UID.** Default `/data/syslog.db` requires `/data` to be a bind-mounted dir owned by `SYSLOG_UID:SYSLOG_GID` (default `1000:1000` per `docker-compose.yml`). See `docs/contracts/data-layout.md` §3.
2. **Listener ports are free.** Default `1514/udp`, `1514/tcp`, `3100/tcp`. The container may need `cap_add: NET_BIND_SERVICE` only if binding port `< 1024` *inside* the container; the published bundle keeps `SYSLOG_PORT=1514` and remaps via Compose.
3. **Non-loopback bind ⇒ auth configured.** Per `src/config.rs::validate_auth_config`: at least one of `mcp.api_token`, `auth.mode = oauth`+token combo (see config-schema §6.1), or `mcp.no_auth = true` (only when an upstream gateway enforces).
4. **OAuth env triple set** when `auth.mode = oauth`: `SYSLOG_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, `SYSLOG_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `SYSLOG_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, plus one of `SYSLOG_MCP_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL` or `mcp.auth.allowed_emails`.
5. **Auth file paths writable.** `auth.db` and `auth-jwt.pem` are created and chmodded to `0600` at startup; the parent dir (default: parent of `storage.db_path`) must be writable.
6. **Docker network exists** (Compose deployments only). `docker-compose.yml` references the external network named by `DOCKER_NETWORK` (default `syslog-mcp`) — must be created before `docker compose up`.

## 8. Restart safety

- **WAL mode is mandatory in practice.** `storage.wal_mode` defaults to `true` and there is no documented support for the rollback-journal mode. WAL guarantees that abrupt restart (SIGKILL, host crash, power loss) loses only **uncommitted** writes — anything that landed in a transaction is durable.
- **Loss window.** On any non-graceful stop, the in-memory batch since the most recent commit may be lost. Upper bound: `[syslog].batch_size` rows or `[syslog].flush_interval` ms of accumulation, whichever comes first (defaults: 100 rows / 500 ms).
- **WAL/SHM sidecar files** (`syslog.db-wal`, `syslog.db-shm`) are auto-rebuilt on first SQL connection if missing. They are transient — see `docs/contracts/data-layout.md`.
- **OAuth state persistence.** Refresh tokens issued before restart remain valid until their TTL (default 8 h) as long as `auth.db` and `auth-jwt.pem` are preserved across the restart. Losing `auth-jwt.pem` invalidates **all** issued tokens; see data-layout §5.
- **No replay log for syslog ingestion.** If the listener loses a packet during shutdown, there is no resend protocol; senders that need delivery guarantees must use TCP transport with retry on the sender side (rsyslog `omfwd` with `queue.type` is the common pattern).

## 9. Unresolved questions

- **Explicit shutdown deadline.** V1 has no `[server].shutdown_timeout_secs` knob. The Tokio runtime drops mid-flight tasks when `tokio::main` returns. If operators report tail-end batch loss on busy shutdowns, the planned fix is an explicit `await` on the writer's drain channel before pool teardown.
- **Explicit WAL checkpoint on shutdown.** No `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` is currently issued. The next startup reads the WAL transparently, but operators copying the DB file alone (without `-wal` and `-shm`) post-stop will see a smaller-than-expected DB. Backup procedure in `docs/contracts/data-layout.md` handles this.
- **Exit-code surface.** As noted in §6, the (1)/(2)/(3)/(other) split is the intended semantics but not yet implemented as distinct `ExitCode` values. Until that ships, systemd `RestartPreventExitStatus=1` will catch all startup misconfigs but cannot distinguish DB-init from bind-error from config-error.
- **SIGHUP as reload.** Some operators ask whether SIGHUP triggers `Config::load` re-evaluation. **It does not in V1**, and there is no plan to add it before V2 — restart-only is the contract.
