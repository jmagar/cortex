# Component Inventory -- cortex

Complete listing of all plugin components.

MCP, REST, and CLI are transport surfaces over the shared service layer. The
runtime MCP action schema is derived from `src/mcp/actions.rs::ACTION_SPECS`
through `src/mcp/schemas.rs::tool_definitions()` and exposed as
`cortex://schema/mcp-tool`; maintained Markdown docs are drift-checked rather
than automatically generated.

## MCP tools

cortex exposes one MCP tool named `cortex`. The required `action`
argument selects the operation. The authoritative action registry lives in
`src/mcp/actions.rs::ACTION_SPECS`; the runtime schema enum is derived from
that registry by `src/mcp/schemas.rs::tool_definitions()`.

| Action | Description | Destructive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search` | Full-text search across syslog messages with FTS5 syntax, host/source_ip/severity/app/time filters | no |
| `filter` | Structured filter-only log retrieval for indexed fields and source aliases | no |
| `tail` | Get N most recent log entries, optionally filtered by host, source_ip, and/or application | no |
| `errors` | Error/warning summary grouped by hostname and severity level with counts | no |
| `hosts` | List all hosts with first/last seen timestamps and total log counts | no |
| `map` | Cached homelab inventory plus graph-backed topology answers | no |

| `status` | Lightweight runtime status: DB health, queue/backpressure state, listener/writer counters, OTLP counters | no |
| `sessions` | AI transcript sessions grouped by project/tool/session/host | no |
| `search_sessions` | Ranked grouped session search | no |
| `abuse` | Abuse-term detector with same-session context | no |
| `abuse_incidents` | Groups abuse hits into scored incident candidates | no |
| `abuse_investigate` | Expands incidents into deterministic evidence bundles | no |
| `ai_correlate` | AI transcript anchors cross-referenced against nearby non-AI logs | no |

| `timeline` | Bucketed log counts over time | no |
| `patterns` | Near-duplicate message template clusters | no |
| `context` | Surrounding logs around a log id or timestamp | no |
| `get` | One log entry by id, including raw frame | no |

| `unaddressed_errors` | Repeating unacknowledged error signatures | no |
| `notifications_recent` | Recent notification firings | no |
| `similar_incidents` | FTS5 historical incident clusters with overlapping AI sessions | no |
| `ask_history` | AI transcript history search with nearby non-AI log context | no |
| `incident_context` | Window bundle of non-AI log aggregates/errors and active AI sessions | no |
| `graph` | Resolve graph entities, neighborhoods, and evidence-backed explanations | no |
| `ack_error` | Acknowledge an error signature | yes |
| `unack_error` | Revoke an error acknowledgement | yes |
| `file_tails` | Manage Cortex-owned file-tail ingest sources | yes |
| `notifications_test` | Send a test Apprise notification | yes |
| `help` | Returns markdown documentation for all actions | no |

Most MCP actions are read-only. `ack_error`, `unack_error`, `file_tails`, and
`notifications_test` require `cortex:admin`; they mutate acknowledgement/audit
or notification state through service-owned actor and safety policy.

## Homelab inventory refresh

`cortex inventory refresh` writes the private cache consumed by MCP
`action=map` under `~/.cortex/inventory`. The server also refreshes that cache
automatically: one refresh runs shortly after startup, then every
`CORTEX_INVENTORY_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS` seconds. Set the interval to `0` to
disable background refresh.

When background refresh is enabled, Cortex also watches local configured
Compose/proxy config paths and refreshes after a short debounce when they
change. Set `CORTEX_INVENTORY_WATCH_ENABLED=false` to disable local file
watching. To use container events as refresh triggers, explicitly set
`CORTEX_INVENTORY_REMOTE_DOCKER_EVENTS=true`; Cortex then opens `docker events`
streams over SSH for selected hosts.

Remote collection is SSH-backed and uses concrete aliases from `~/.ssh/config`
unless `CORTEX_INVENTORY_SSH_HOSTS` is set. It collects host facts, listener
ports, storage summaries, Compose YAML artifacts, reverse proxy conf artifacts,
and compact Docker inspect data including container status/health, image,
published ports, networks, mounts, compose/route labels, and environment key
names only. It does not store environment values.

SSH targets are validated before invoking OpenSSH, option-like hosts are
rejected, and the command builder inserts `--` before the host argument.
Inventory collectors and remote Docker event streams share strict host-key
defaults, a fleet-wide concurrency budget, and retry backoff. Deploy helpers
share host validation, the `--` delimiter, and the host-key argument policy, but
they do not use the inventory retry/concurrency context. The default is
`StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`; bootstrap TOFU is available only when explicitly
opted in with `CORTEX_INVENTORY_SSH_TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE=true`. Set
`CORTEX_INVENTORY_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` when automation should use a managed
known-hosts file.

Optional provider collectors are activated only when their URL/credential env
vars are present. Supported media prefixes are `SONARR`, `RADARR`, `PROWLARR`,
`SABNZBD`, `QBITTORRENT`, `PLEX`, `TAUTULLI`, and `OVERSEERR`.

The MCP `map` action defaults to the bounded snapshot. Set `mode` to ask
topology questions backed by the graph projection:

```json
{"action":"map","mode":"host_services","host":"squirts"}
{"action":"map","mode":"domain_routes","domain":"adguard.tootie.tv"}
{"action":"map","mode":"service_dependencies","host":"squirts","service":"swag"}
{"action":"map","mode":"findings","finding_limit":25}
```

Non-snapshot responses include `graph_answer.answer_status`, bounded `rows`,
safe evidence samples, map-native `next_queries`, and graph `proof_queries`.
`mode=findings` instead fills `graph_answer.findings` with supported topology
findings: `potential_public_route`, `risky_mounts`, and `collector_health`.
These findings use relationship-specific graph proof for configured routes and
mounts, normalized inventory for mount source/target/read-only detail, and
cache/collector state for degraded-confidence context. Evidence is intentionally
safe: no raw config bodies, raw cache paths, credential-bearing upstream URLs,
raw collector warnings, raw frames, or `metadata_json` are returned.
