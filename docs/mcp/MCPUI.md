# MCP UI Patterns -- cortex

Protocol-level UI hints for MCP servers to improve client-side rendering of tools and results.

## Current state

cortex ships one MCP Apps surface: an interactive query widget.

- **Resource:** `ui://cortex/query-widget`, served through `resources/list` and `resources/read` with MIME `text/html;profile=mcp-app` (see `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs`).
- **Tool link:** the `cortex` tool carries `_meta.ui.resourceUri` pointing at that resource with `visibility: ["model", "app"]`.
- **Structured results:** `tools/call` returns both readable JSON text content and `structuredContent` so UI hosts can render rows without re-parsing text.
- **Widget UI:** `src/mcp/ui/query_widget.html` is a self-contained, dependency-free page (FTS5 query + hostname/severity/limit filters) that calls the `cortex` tool with `action=search` over an MCP Apps host bridge — `window.openai.callTool` when the host injects it, otherwise an mcp-ui `postMessage` adapter (`type:"tool"` → `ui-message-response`). It degrades to a visible "bridge unavailable" state when no host bridge responds, and renders all log fields via `textContent` to avoid HTML injection.

### Security model of the widget bridge

- **Inbound messages are origin-bound.** The `postMessage` handler accepts a response only when `event.source === window.parent` and the `messageId` matches the in-flight request exactly (it fails closed — a host that cannot echo the id times out rather than risking a stale/spoofed response). Reflected host error strings are length-capped and written via `textContent`.
- **Outbound `postMessage` uses `targetOrigin: "*"`.** This is an inherent limitation of serving the widget from the `ui://` scheme: the framed widget cannot know its parent's real origin, so it cannot pin one. The outbound payload carries only the tool name and search parameters (no tokens or secrets), so the exposure is minimal. A host that serves the widget from a real HTTPS origin can pin that origin instead.
- **A defense-in-depth CSP** (`img-src 'none'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'`) blocks egress/injection vectors the widget never uses. `script-src`/`connect-src` are intentionally left open so a host can inject its bridge; tightening them requires live-host verification (see bead `syslog-mcp-7kqp2`).

Tool inputs otherwise use standard JSON Schema properties without `x-ui-*` extensions.

## Schema annotations available

Tool schemas support optional UI hints that clients can interpret:

### Parameter widgets

```json
{
  "severity": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["emerg", "alert", "crit", "err", "warning", "notice", "info", "debug"],
    "description": "Filter by syslog severity level"
  }
}
```

The `enum` constraint already enables clients to render a dropdown/select widget without explicit UI annotations.

### Time range inputs

```json
{
  "from": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "Start of time range (ISO 8601, e.g., '2025-01-15T00:00:00Z')"
  }
}
```

Clients that support datetime widgets can detect ISO 8601 format from the description.

## Response formatting

Tool responses return JSON as text content. Clients render this according to their capabilities:
- CLI clients: raw JSON or formatted with jq
- Web clients: parsed and rendered as tables
- LLM clients: interpreted directly

## Future enhancements

If MCP UI annotations are adopted:

| Action | Possible UI hint |
| --- | --- |
| `cortex search` | Multi-line text input for query, datetime pickers for from/to |
| `cortex tail` | Slider for n parameter |
| `cortex correlate` | Datetime picker for reference_time, slider for window_minutes |
| `cortex errors` | Datetime range picker |
