# Skill Incident Detection, Investigation, and Deterministic Findings (GH #94 PR 3/4) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Detect negative-signal patterns following a skill event, group them into scored incidents with a stable incident id, and build a bounded investigation evidence bundle with deterministic (non-LLM) findings.

**Architecture:** Five deterministic, phrase-boundary signal detectors (`src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs`) classify transcript log messages as anchors for `user_correction_after_skill`, `tool_failure_after_skill`, `scope_or_source_confusion`, `ignored_skill_or_policy_instruction`, and `overlong_loop_after_skill`. A DB-layer query (`search_ai_skill_incidents`) groups `ai_skill_events` rows by `(skill_name, skill_plugin, tool, project, session_id, hostname, window_bucket)`, runs the detectors over the session's nearby transcript rows, and scores/sorts each group into a `SkillIncident` with a stable synthetic `incident_id`. A second DB-layer query (`investigate_ai_skill_incidents`) expands a `SkillIncident` into a bounded, truncation-flagged `SkillIncidentEvidence` bundle (skill events, signal anchors, transcript before/after, nearby tool failures/corrections/logs/errors), which the app layer enriches with `SkillIncidentFindings` computed by a pure rule-evaluation module (`src/app/skill_incident_findings.rs`) — no DB or LLM calls. All of this is exposed identically through MCP actions (`skill_incidents`, `skill_investigate`), REST routes, and a skill-first CLI (`cortex sessions skill-investigate <skill>`) that resolves the top-priority incident for a skill and summarizes the rest via `other_matching_incidents`.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 2024 edition, `rusqlite` (bundled SQLite, WAL mode), `serde`/`serde_json` for wire types.

## Global Constraints

- **This PR depends on PR 2 (Skill Event Extraction) being merged first** — it queries the `ai_skill_events` table and consumes `AiSkillEventParams`/`AiSkillEventEntry` from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-01-skill-event-extraction.md`. Before starting Task 1, `grep -rn "AiSkillEventEntry\|ai_skill_events" src/` to confirm PR 2 has actually landed and its real field names match what this plan assumes (see the source file's own "verify against actual code" callout at the top of Task 1).
- Float score sorting (`priority_score: f64`) must use `f64::total_cmp()`, not `partial_cmp()` — `partial_cmp` returns `None` on NaN and silently corrupts sort order.
- Bounded evidence with explicit truncation flags on every collection — never silently claim complete evidence when caps were hit.
- `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` must pass before any task is considered done.
- Every new MCP action needs a row in `src/mcp/actions.rs` (`ACTION_SPECS`) + a dispatch arm in `src/mcp/tools.rs` + docs updates (`docs/mcp/TOOLS.md`, `docs/mcp/SCHEMA.md`, `docs/contracts/mcp-actions-current.md`, `CLAUDE.md` action table + count).
- **PR sequencing note:** This is PR 3 of 4 for GH #94 Plan A. PR 4 (skill assessment + unified `cortex assess` CLI) depends on this PR (needs `SkillIncident`/`AiSkillInvestigateResponse` evidence types) and on PR 1 (needs `LlmRunner`) — do not implement PR 4 until this PR and PR 1 are both merged.

---


## Verify-against-actual-code callout (read before Task 1)

This phase assumes the prior "skill events" phase has landed:

- Table `ai_skill_events` with columns `id, log_id, ai_tool, ai_project, ai_session_id, hostname, timestamp, skill_name, skill_plugin, skill_path, event_kind, evidence_kind, metadata_json, created_at`, created inline in `src/db/pool.rs` (this repo's migrations are `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` blocks in `init_pool`/`run_migrations`, NOT a separate migrations directory — confirm by grepping `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in `src/db/pool.rs`).
- DB-layer params/entry types, assumed named `AiSkillEventParams` and `AiSkillEventEntry` in `src/db/models.rs`, with a query function (assumed `search_ai_skill_events` or similar) in `src/db/queries.rs`.
- App-layer mirrors in `src/app/models/` (likely `src/app/models/ai_skill_events.rs` or folded into an existing `ai_*` model file) and a service method on `src/app/services/ai.rs`.

**Before writing Task 1**, grep the actual repo for the real names:

```bash
grep -rn "ai_skill_events\|AiSkillEvent" src/db/models.rs src/db/queries.rs src/app/models/ src/app/services/ src/mcp/actions.rs src/mcp/tools.rs
```

If the real struct/field/function names differ from the assumptions above (e.g. `SkillEventParams` instead of `AiSkillEventParams`, or the table lives under a different column set), **update every reference in this phase's tasks to match the real names before implementing** — do not silently proceed with mismatched names. The column set assumed above (`id, log_id, ai_tool, ai_project, ai_session_id, hostname, timestamp, skill_name, skill_plugin, skill_path, event_kind, evidence_kind, metadata_json, created_at`) is treated as ground truth for all SQL in this plan; adjust column names in every `SELECT`/`INSERT`/index statement below if the actual schema differs.

This plan also assumes indexes named (or equivalent to):
- `idx_ai_skill_events_skill_time` on `(skill_name, timestamp)`
- `idx_ai_skill_events_session_time` on `(ai_tool, ai_project, ai_session_id, timestamp)`
- `idx_ai_skill_events_project_skill_time` on `(ai_project, skill_name, timestamp)`

If those index names differ, the `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` assertions in Task 3's regression test must be updated to match the real index name (SQLite's `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` output embeds the literal index name — a mismatched literal will fail even if the plan is otherwise correct).

## Locked interfaces for other phases

These are the structs/functions this phase defines. A later "skill LLM assessment" phase will serialize `AiSkillInvestigateResult` (specifically each `SkillIncidentEvidence` inside it) into an LLM prompt — field names here are final.

App-layer (`src/app/models/ai_skill_incidents.rs`) mirrors these 1:1 with `From<db::X>` impls, exactly like `src/app/models/ai_incidents.rs` mirrors `db::AbuseIncident`/`db::IncidentEvidence` — same field names, plus `findings: skill_incident_findings::SkillIncidentFindings` attached inside the `From<db::SkillIncidentEvidence>` conversion (mirrors how `IncidentEvidence::from` in `src/app/models/ai_incidents.rs:104-137` attaches `incident_findings::derive_incident_findings(...)`).

MCP action names: `skill_incidents`, `skill_investigate` (both `Scope::Read`, added to `ACTION_SPECS` in `src/mcp/actions.rs` and `ActionHandler` enum).

CLI surface: `cortex sessions skill-incidents` and `cortex sessions skill-investigate <skill>` (this repo's CLI convention places all AI-transcript subcommands under `cortex sessions <subcommand>` — the top-level `cortex ai` alias was explicitly removed, see `removed_top_level_commands_fail_with_replacement_guidance` in `src/cli/parse_tests.rs`. The phase brief's `cortex ai skill-investigate ...` examples are illustrative; the real, wired command is `cortex sessions skill-investigate ...`. Task 8 documents this explicitly).

REST routes: `GET /api/sessions/skill-incidents`, `GET /api/sessions/skill-investigate`.

### Task 1: Signal-anchor detector — `user_correction_after_skill` and `tool_failure_after_skill`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs`
- Modify: `src/app/mod.rs` (add `pub mod skill_signal_detectors;` near existing `pub mod incident_findings;` — grep `mod incident_findings` in `src/app/mod.rs` to find the exact insertion point)
- Test: `src/app/skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs` (sidecar convention: `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs` ends with `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs"] mod tests;`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `crate::app::models::LogEntry` (existing, from `src/app/models.rs` or wherever `LogEntry` is re-exported at the app layer — verify via `grep -n "pub struct LogEntry" src/app/models*.rs src/db/models.rs`; it is defined once in `src/db/models.rs` and re-exported through `src/app/models.rs`'s `pub use db::LogEntry;` pattern — confirm with `grep -n "LogEntry" src/app/models.rs`).
- Produces: `pub const SIGNAL_USER_CORRECTION_AFTER_SKILL: &str = "user_correction_after_skill";`, `pub const SIGNAL_TOOL_FAILURE_AFTER_SKILL: &str = "tool_failure_after_skill";`, `pub fn detect_user_correction(message: &str) -> bool`, `pub fn detect_tool_failure(message: &str) -> bool`. These are consumed by Task 3's grouping/scoring logic and Task 4's evidence-bundle nearby_tool_failures/nearby_user_corrections split.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

Create `src/app/skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs`:

```rust
use super::*;

#[test]
fn detects_direct_correction_phrases() {
    let positives = [
        "That's not what I asked for, please redo it.",
        "You said you would run the tests but you didn't.",
        "This is just wrong, revert it.",
        "No, that's the wrong file entirely.",
        "We wasted twenty minutes on this dead end.",
        "All you had to say was 'I don't know'.",
        "Stop, you're going in circles.",
        "You didn't need to touch that config at all.",
    ];
    for msg in positives {
        assert!(detect_user_correction(msg), "expected correction hit for: {msg}");
    }
}

#[test]
fn does_not_flag_unrelated_negatives() {
    let negatives = [
        "No new errors were found in the log scan.",
        "The stop hook fired successfully.",
        "You said the deploy finished — confirming that now.",
        "wrongdoing was not detected in the audit",
    ];
    for msg in negatives {
        assert!(
            !detect_user_correction(msg),
            "unexpected correction hit for: {msg}"
        );
    }
}

#[test]
fn detects_tool_failure_phrases() {
    let positives = [
        "Command exited with exit code 1",
        "bash: permission denied",
        "error: file not found",
        "operation timed out after 30s",
        "failed to connect to database",
        "database is locked",
        "429 rate limit exceeded",
    ];
    for msg in positives {
        assert!(detect_tool_failure(msg), "expected tool-failure hit for: {msg}");
    }
}

#[test]
fn does_not_flag_successful_tool_output_as_failure() {
    let negatives = [
        "build completed successfully in 4.2s",
        "all 42 tests passed",
        "pushed to origin/main",
    ];
    for msg in negatives {
        assert!(
            !detect_tool_failure(msg),
            "unexpected tool-failure hit for: {msg}"
        );
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cargo test --lib skill_signal_detectors -- --nocapture
```

Expected: compile error (`skill_signal_detectors` module and its functions do not exist yet) — `error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared crate or module 'skill_signal_detectors'` or similar, since `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs` has not been created yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Create `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs`:

```rust
//! Deterministic, phrase-boundary keyword detectors for skill-incident anchor
//! signals. Pure functions over log message text — no DB, no LLM. Mirrors the
//! word/phrase-boundary matching style of `first_abuse_term`/`is_abuse_boundary`
//! in `src/db/queries.rs`, but operates on the app layer since these detectors
//! are shared by both the DB-layer grouping query (Task 3) and the evidence
//! bundle nearby-log classification (Task 4).

];

/// Case-insensitive substring match on whole phrases (already multi-word, so

fn contains_any_phrase(haystack_lower: &str, phrases: &[&str]) -> bool {
    phrases.iter().any(|p| haystack_lower.contains(p))
}

pub fn detect_user_correction(message: &str) -> bool {
    let lower = message.to_ascii_lowercase();
    contains_any_phrase(&lower, USER_CORRECTION_PHRASES)
}

pub fn detect_tool_failure(message: &str) -> bool {
    let lower = message.to_ascii_lowercase();
    contains_any_phrase(&lower, TOOL_FAILURE_PHRASES)
}

#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs"]
mod tests;
```

Add to `src/app/mod.rs` (find the line `pub mod incident_findings;` — or wherever `mod` declarations for app submodules live — and add immediately after it):

```rust
pub mod skill_signal_detectors;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cargo test --lib skill_signal_detectors -- --nocapture
```

Expected: `test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed` (the four `#[test]` functions in `skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs src/app/skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs src/app/mod.rs
git commit -m "feat: add user_correction and tool_failure skill-incident signal detectors"
```

### Task 2: Signal-anchor detectors — `scope_or_source_confusion`, `ignored_skill_or_policy_instruction`, `overlong_loop_after_skill`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs` (append to the file created in Task 1)
- Test: `src/app/skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Produces: `pub fn detect_scope_or_source_confusion(message: &str) -> bool`, `pub fn detect_ignored_instruction(message: &str) -> bool`, `pub fn detect_overlong_loop(skill_event_count: usize, tool_call_count: usize, has_correction_or_frustration_signal: bool) -> bool`. All three consumed by Task 3 grouping and Task 6 findings module.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

Append to `src/app/skill_signal_detectors_tests.rs`:

    ];
    for msg in positives {

```bash

Expected: compile error — `detect_scope_or_source_confusion`, `detect_ignored_instruction`, `detect_overlong_loop` are not defined.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Append to `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs` (before the `#[cfg(test)]` block at the end — move the existing trailing `#[cfg(test)] #[path = ...] mod tests;` to the very end of the file after this new code):

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cargo test --lib skill_signal_detectors -- --nocapture
```

Expected: `test result: ok. 10 passed; 0 failed` (4 from Task 1 + 6 new).

git add src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs
git commit -m "feat: add scope-confusion, ignored-instruction, overlong-loop skill signal detectors"
```

### Task 3: Grouping, scoring, and stable incident id — `search_ai_skill_incidents` DB query

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/db/models.rs` (append the `AiSkillIncidentParams`, `SkillIncident`, `SkillSignalCounts`, `AiSkillIncidentResult` structs from "Locked interfaces" above, placed after the existing `AiIncidentResult` struct around line 521 — grep `pub struct AiIncidentResult` to find the exact line)
- Modify: `src/db/queries.rs` (add `search_ai_skill_incidents()` function; place it directly after `search_ai_incidents()` / `ai_incident_anchor_sql()`, i.e. after line ~2360 — grep `fn investigate_ai_incidents` to find the boundary and insert before it)
- Test: `src/db/queries_tests.rs` (this repo's sidecar convention: `src/db/queries.rs` has `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "queries_tests.rs"] mod tests;` at its end — add new `#[test]` functions there)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `AiSkillEventEntry`/skill-events table from the prior phase (verify exact struct/column names per the Task-1-of-this-doc callout at top). Also consumes `crate::app::skill_signal_detectors::{detect_user_correction, detect_tool_failure, detect_scope_or_source_confusion, detect_ignored_instruction, detect_overlong_loop, ALL_SIGNALS}` from Tasks 1-2. Note: `src/db/queries.rs` is below `src/app/` in the dependency graph in this repo's module layout (db has no dependency on app) — confirm with `grep -n "^use crate::app" src/db/queries.rs`. If db cannot depend on app (likely, since app depends on db not vice versa), the detector functions must instead live in `src/db/` (e.g. a new `src/db/skill_signal_detectors.rs` reachable from `src/db/queries.rs`, with `src/app/skill_signal_detectors.rs` becoming a thin `pub use crate::db::skill_signal_detectors::*;` re-export so Task 6's findings module can still `use super::skill_signal_detectors` at the app layer). **Resolve this before Step 3 by running the grep above; if db cannot see app, move the Task 1/2 detector module to `src/db/skill_signal_detectors.rs` and adjust Tasks 1, 2, and 6 file paths accordingly.** For the remainder of this task, code below assumes detectors are reachable from `src/db/queries.rs` as `crate::app::skill_signal_detectors::*` — swap the `use` path if the module was relocated.
- Produces: `pub fn search_ai_skill_incidents(pool: &DbPool, params: &AiSkillIncidentParams) -> Result<AiSkillIncidentResult>` — consumed by Task 4's investigation bundle builder and the service/MCP/CLI/REST layers in Task 5.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

Append to `src/db/queries_tests.rs` (near the existing `search_ai_incidents_anchor_plan_avoids_temp_order_sort` test, after `make_ai_entry`):

Note: if `src/db/queries.rs` genuinely cannot `use crate::app::...` (check for a `#![forbid]`/module-visibility issue via `cargo check` after adding this), move `skill_signal_detectors.rs` to `src/db/skill_signal_detectors.rs`, change all `crate::app::skill_signal_detectors::` references above to `crate::db::skill_signal_detectors::` (or a local `super::skill_signal_detectors::` if declared as a sibling module in `src/db/mod.rs`), and update Task 1/Task 2's `Modify: src/app/mod.rs` step to instead modify `src/db/mod.rs`, keeping a `pub use crate::db::skill_signal_detectors as skill_signal_detectors;` line in `src/app/mod.rs` so Task 6's `use super::skill_signal_detectors` in the app-layer findings module still resolves.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cargo test --lib search_ai_skill_incidents -- --nocapture
```

Expected: `test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed` (the three tests added in Step 1).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/db/models.rs src/db/queries.rs src/db/queries_tests.rs
git commit -m "feat: add search_ai_skill_incidents grouping/scoring query with stable incident ids"
```

---

### Task 4: Investigation bundle builder — `investigate_ai_skill_incidents` DB query with truncation flags

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/db/models.rs` (append `AiSkillInvestigateParams`, `SkillIncidentEvidence`, `AiSkillInvestigateResult`, `SkillIncidentSummary` structs from "Locked interfaces", after the `AiSkillIncidentResult` struct added in Task 3)
- Modify: `src/db/queries.rs` (add `investigate_ai_skill_incidents()`, placed directly after `search_ai_skill_incidents()` from Task 3)
- Test: `src/db/queries_tests.rs` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `search_ai_skill_incidents` (Task 3), `AiSkillEventEntry`/skill-events query function from the prior phase (verify real name; assumed `crate::db::queries::skill_events_for_incident` does NOT exist yet — this task must fetch the `ai_skill_events` rows for a group directly via `skill_event_ids` using an `IN (...)` query, mirroring how `investigate_ai_incidents` fetches anchors via `anchor_ids`).
- Produces: `pub fn investigate_ai_skill_incidents(pool: &DbPool, params: &AiSkillInvestigateParams) -> Result<AiSkillInvestigateResult>` — consumed by the service/MCP/CLI/REST layers in Task 5 and by Task 7's skill-first CLI resolution logic.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

Append to `src/db/queries_tests.rs`:

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cargo test --lib investigate_ai_skill_incidents -- --nocapture
```

Expected: compile error — `investigate_ai_skill_incidents`, `AiSkillInvestigateParams` do not exist yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Append to `src/db/models.rs` after `AiSkillIncidentResult`:

```rust
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Skill investigate — evidence bundle layer (kmib-skill.2)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct AiSkillInvestigateParams {

    pub since: Option<String>,
    pub until: Option<String>,
    /// Max incidents to investigate. Default 3, clamp 1..=10.
    pub limit: Option<u32>,

    pub correlation_window_minutes: Option<u32>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SkillIncidentEvidence {
    pub incident: SkillIncident,
    /// The `ai_skill_events` rows in this group, capped at 25.

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct AiSkillInvestigateResult {
    pub evidence: Vec<SkillIncidentEvidence>,
    pub total_incidents: usize,
    pub truncated: bool,
}
```

**Important:** `AiSkillEventEntry` here must be the exact type from the prior skill-events phase (per the Task-1-of-this-doc callout) — if that struct lives in `src/db/models.rs` already, do not redefine it; just reference it directly. If its real name differs (e.g. `SkillEventEntry`), replace every occurrence of `AiSkillEventEntry` in this task and in the "Locked interfaces" section at the top of this file with the real name.

Add to `src/db/queries.rs`, directly after `search_ai_skill_incidents`:

```rust

    pool: &DbPool,
    params: &AiSkillInvestigateParams,

    const SIGNAL_ANCHORS_CAP: usize = 50;

    const NEARBY_CAP: usize = 50;
    const NEARBY_SUBSET_CAP: usize = 25;

    let limit = params.limit.unwrap_or(3).clamp(1, 10) as usize;

**Callout:** `map_skill_event_row` is a placeholder name — the prior skill-events phase's query function already has a row-mapper closure/function for `ai_skill_events` rows (13 columns). Grep `src/db/queries.rs` for the existing skill-events query function (likely named `search_ai_skill_events` or similar per the callout at the top of this document) and reuse its exact row-mapping logic/closure instead of writing a new one, to avoid column-order drift between the two queries.

- Modify: `src/app/models.rs` (or `src/app/models/mod.rs` — grep `mod ai_incidents;` to find the exact declaration site and add `pub mod ai_skill_incidents;` beside it, plus re-export via `pub use ai_skill_incidents::*;` matching the existing `pub use ai_incidents::*;` pattern)
- Modify: `src/app/services/ai.rs` (add `list_ai_skill_incidents` and `investigate_ai_skill_incidents` service methods after the existing `investigate_ai_incidents` method, ~line 259)
- Modify: `src/mcp/actions.rs` (add `skill_incidents` and `skill_investigate` action specs + `ActionHandler` variants)
- Modify: `src/mcp/tools.rs` (add dispatch arms + handler functions)
- Modify: `src/api.rs` (add `GET /api/sessions/skill-incidents` and `GET /api/sessions/skill-investigate` routes + query structs + handlers)
- Test: `src/app/service_tests.rs` (append; this file already tests `investigate_ai_incidents` around line 117, follow that pattern)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `db::search_ai_skill_incidents`, `db::investigate_ai_skill_incidents` (Task 3, 4), `db::AiSkillIncidentParams`, `db::AiSkillInvestigateParams`.
- Produces: `AiSkillIncidentRequest`, `AiSkillIncidentResponse`, `AiSkillInvestigateRequest`, `AiSkillInvestigateResponse` (app/wire layer, mirroring `AiIncidentRequest`/`AiIncidentResponse`/`AiInvestigateRequest`/`AiInvestigateResponse` in `src/app/models/ai_incidents.rs`), plus `AppService::list_ai_skill_incidents`, `AppService::investigate_ai_skill_incidents_bundle` (name it `investigate_ai_skill_incidents` unless that collides with the db-layer import — check via `cargo check`; if it collides, name the service method `investigate_skill_incidents` and note this rename in Task 7/8). These are consumed by Task 7 (CLI) and Task 8 (docs).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

Append to `src/app/service_tests.rs` (mirror the existing `investigate_ai_incidents` test at line 117 — read it first via `sed -n '90,140p' src/app/service_tests.rs` to copy its exact `AppService`-construction boilerplate, then adapt):

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn list_ai_skill_incidents_empty_db_returns_no_data() {
    let service = test_app_service().await; // reuse this file's existing test-service constructor
    let response = service
        .list_ai_skill_incidents(AiSkillIncidentRequest::default())
        .await
        .unwrap();
    assert_eq!(response.incidents.len(), 0);
    assert_eq!(response.total_incidents, 0);
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn investigate_ai_skill_incidents_empty_db_returns_no_data_flag() {
    let service = test_app_service().await;
    let response = service
        .investigate_ai_skill_incidents(AiSkillInvestigateRequest::default())
        .await
        .unwrap();
    assert_eq!(response.evidence.len(), 0);
    assert!(response.no_data);
    assert!(!response.suggested_filters.is_empty());
}
```

(If this file's existing tests use a different constructor name than `test_app_service()`, grep `src/app/service_tests.rs` for the helper used by the `investigate_ai_incidents` test at line 117 and use that exact name instead.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cargo test --lib list_ai_skill_incidents_empty_db_returns_no_data investigate_ai_skill_incidents_empty_db_returns_no_data_flag -- --nocapture
```

Expected: compile error — `AiSkillIncidentRequest`, `AiSkillInvestigateRequest`, and the two service methods do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Create `src/app/models/ai_skill_incidents.rs` (mirrors `src/app/models/ai_incidents.rs` structure exactly):

Add `pub mod ai_skill_incidents;` and re-export next to the existing `ai_incidents` declaration in `src/app/models.rs` (grep `mod ai_incidents` for the exact spot) — copy the exact visibility/re-export pattern already used there.

In `src/app/services/ai.rs`, append after `investigate_ai_incidents` (~line 259):

```rust

    let to = parse_optional_timestamp(req.until.as_deref(), "until")?;
    let has_skill_filter = req.skill.is_some() || req.plugin.is_some();
    let result = self

        .await?;

    let no_data = result.evidence.is_empty() && result.total_incidents == 0;
    let suggested_filters = if no_data {
        vec![
            "widen --since (e.g. --since 30d)".to_string(),

        other_matching_incidents: Vec::new(), // populated by Task 7's skill-first CLI wrapper
        no_incident_low_severity_summary: false, // populated by Task 7
        no_data,
        suggested_filters,
    })
}
```

Note: `has_skill_filter` above is unused by this minimal version (it's plumbed for Task 7 to use when deciding whether to run the skill-first resolution wrapper vs. the plain incident-id path) — either remove it now with `#[allow(unused)]` or leave it for Task 7 to consume; Task 7 replaces this method's body with logic that calls this one internally, so keep the signature stable.

In `src/mcp/actions.rs`:
1. Add two variants to `ActionHandler` enum (after `IncidentContext,`): `SkillIncidents,` and `SkillInvestigate,`.
2. Add two `action_spec!` entries after the `"abuse_investigate"` entry (~line 330):

```rust
    action_spec!(
        "skill_incidents",
        Read,
        "List detected skill-usage incidents (negative signals after a skill loaded)",
        Moderate,
        SkillIncidents
    ),
    action_spec!(
        "skill_investigate",
        Read,
        "Deep-dive investigation of a skill-usage incident, skill-first",
        Expensive,
        SkillInvestigate
    ),
```

In `src/mcp/tools.rs`:
1. Import `AiSkillIncidentRequest, AiSkillInvestigateRequest` alongside the existing `AiIncidentRequest` import (~line 20).
2. Add dispatch arms after the `H::AbuseInvestigate => tool_abuse_investigate(state, args).await,` line (~line 94):

```rust
        H::SkillIncidents => tool_skill_incidents(state, args).await,
        H::SkillInvestigate => tool_skill_investigate(state, args).await,
```

3. Add handler functions after `tool_abuse_investigate` (~line 232):

```rust
async fn tool_skill_incidents(state: &AppState, args: Value) -> anyhow::Result<Value> {
    let req: AiSkillIncidentRequest = action_payload(args, "skill_incidents")?;
    let response = state.service.list_ai_skill_incidents(req).await?;
    tracing::info!(
        incident_count = response.incidents.len(),
        total = response.total_incidents,
        "skill_incidents completed"
    );
    Ok(serde_json::to_value(response)?)
}

async fn tool_skill_investigate(state: &AppState, args: Value) -> anyhow::Result<Value> {
    let req: AiSkillInvestigateRequest = action_payload(args, "skill_investigate")?;
    let response = state.service.investigate_ai_skill_incidents(req).await?;
    tracing::info!(
        total_incidents = response.total_incidents,
        no_data = response.no_data,
        "skill_investigate completed"
    );
    Ok(serde_json::to_value(response)?)
}
```

(Match the exact return shape of `tool_abuse_incidents`/`tool_abuse_investigate` at lines 215-233 — if those wrap with a different helper than `serde_json::to_value`, use that helper instead.)

In `src/api.rs`, add after the existing `ai_investigate` handler (~line 1121):

Register both routes in the router builder next to the existing `/api/sessions/incidents` and `/api/sessions/investigate` routes (~lines 265-266):

```rust
        .route("/api/sessions/skill-incidents", get(ai_skill_incidents))
        .route("/api/sessions/skill-investigate", get(ai_skill_investigate))
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cargo test --lib list_ai_skill_incidents_empty_db_returns_no_data investigate_ai_skill_incidents_empty_db_returns_no_data_flag -- --nocapture
cargo build
```

Expected: both tests `ok`, and `cargo build` succeeds with no errors (this is the first point all layers compile together — expect to fix small type mismatches from the "verify against actual code" callout at this step, e.g. the real `AiSkillEventEntry` name).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/app/models/ai_skill_incidents.rs src/app/models.rs src/app/services/ai.rs src/mcp/actions.rs src/mcp/tools.rs src/api.rs src/app/service_tests.rs
git commit -m "feat: wire skill_incidents/skill_investigate through service, MCP, and REST layers"
```

### Task 6: Deterministic findings module — `src/app/skill_incident_findings.rs`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/app/skill_incident_findings.rs`
- Modify: `src/app/mod.rs` (add `pub mod skill_incident_findings;` beside `pub mod incident_findings;`)
- Test: `src/app/skill_incident_findings_tests.rs` (sidecar convention)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `SkillIncident`, `LogEntry`, `AiSkillEventEntry` (app-layer types from Task 5), `crate::app::skill_signal_detectors::*` (Tasks 1-2).
- Produces: the `SkillIncidentFindings`/`SkillFailureMode`/`SkillContributingFactor`/`SkillPreventionHint` structs and `derive_skill_incident_findings` function specified in "Locked interfaces" at the top of this document — consumed by `src/app/models/ai_skill_incidents.rs`'s `From<db::SkillIncidentEvidence>` impl (Task 5) and, in a later phase, serialized directly into an LLM prompt.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

Create `src/app/skill_incident_findings_tests.rs`:

Add `pub mod skill_incident_findings;` to `src/app/mod.rs` beside `pub mod incident_findings;`.

**Note on the test file's imports:** the test file above references `WRONG_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH`, `MISSING_VERIFICATION_STEP`, etc. via `use super::*;` — since these are declared `pub const` in the module under test, this resolves automatically once the module compiles. The `_skill_events` parameter type `super::models::AiSkillEventEntry` must be swapped for the real type name per the Task-1 callout; if the real type instead lives directly under `crate::db` with no app-layer re-export, change the import to `crate::db::AiSkillEventEntry` (or whatever the real name is) both here and in the `From<db::SkillIncidentEvidence>` call site in Task 5's `src/app/models/ai_skill_incidents.rs`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cargo test --lib skill_incident_findings -- --nocapture
```

Expected: `test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed`.

### Task 7: Skill-first CLI UX — `cortex sessions skill-investigate <skill>` positional resolution, `other_matching_incidents`, no-data path

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/cli/args/sessions.rs` (add `SkillIncidents(SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs)` and `SkillInvestigate(SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs)` variants to `SessionsCommand`, plus the two arg structs)
- Modify: `src/cli/parse/sessions.rs` (add `"skill-incidents"` and `"skill-investigate"` to `SESSIONS_SUBCOMMANDS`, add parse functions with positional-arg handling for `skill-investigate`)
- Modify: `src/cli/dispatch_sessions.rs` (add `run_ai_skill_incidents`, `run_ai_skill_investigate` dispatch functions; `run_ai_skill_investigate` implements the skill-first resolution: fetch incidents matching the skill, pick top-priority, populate `other_matching_incidents`)
- Modify: `src/cli/run.rs` (wire the two new `SessionsCommand` variants to their dispatch functions)
- Modify: `src/app/services/ai.rs` (extend `investigate_ai_skill_incidents` from Task 5, or add a wrapping method `investigate_ai_skill_incidents_by_skill`, so the skill-first logic — top-incident selection + `other_matching_incidents` + no-signal low-severity summary — lives at the service layer and is shared by CLI, MCP, and REST, not duplicated in the CLI)
- Test: `src/cli/dispatch_sessions_tests.rs` (sidecar for `dispatch_sessions.rs`), `src/cli/parse/sessions_tests.rs` (sidecar for `parse/sessions.rs`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `AiSkillInvestigateRequest`/`AiSkillInvestigateResponse`/`AppService::investigate_ai_skill_incidents` (Task 5), `SkillIncidentSummary` (Task 5).
- Produces: `SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs`, `SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs` CLI arg structs; `run_ai_skill_incidents`, `run_ai_skill_investigate` dispatch functions; an extended/wrapping service method that fills `other_matching_incidents` and `no_incident_low_severity_summary` on `AiSkillInvestigateResponse`. This is the final layer other phases interact with only via the wire types already locked in Task 5 — no new types are introduced here beyond CLI arg structs.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (full real code)

First, the service-layer skill-first resolution logic needs a test. Append to `src/app/service_tests.rs`:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn investigate_ai_skill_incidents_by_skill_picks_top_priority_and_lists_others() {
    let service = test_app_service().await; // same helper as Task 5's tests

    // Seed two sessions for the same skill: one low-signal, one high-signal.
    // (Use the service's local DB pool the same way other service_tests.rs
    // tests seed data — grep this file for how `investigate_ai_incidents`
    // tests seed logs via `service.pool()` or an equivalent accessor, and
    // reuse that exact pattern here instead of reinventing seeding.)
    // ... seed sess-low (skill event only) and sess-high (skill event +
    // correction + tool failure) for skill "lavra:lavra-plan" ...

    let response = service
        .investigate_ai_skill_incidents(AiSkillInvestigateRequest {
            skill: Some("lavra:lavra-plan".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .await
        .unwrap();

    assert_eq!(response.evidence.len(), 1, "skill-first default returns the single top incident");
    assert_eq!(
        response.evidence[0].incident.session_id, "sess-high",
        "top-priority incident must be the higher-signal session"
    );
    assert_eq!(
        response.other_matching_incidents.len(),
        1,
        "the lower-priority incident must be summarized in other_matching_incidents"
    );
    assert_eq!(response.other_matching_incidents[0].priority_label, "low");
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn investigate_ai_skill_incidents_low_signal_returns_summary_not_error() {
    let service = test_app_service().await;
    // Seed exactly one skill event for "lavra:lavra-plan" with no negative signal.
    // ...

    let response = service
        .investigate_ai_skill_incidents(AiSkillInvestigateRequest {
            skill: Some("lavra:lavra-plan".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .await
        .unwrap();

    assert!(!response.no_data);
    assert_eq!(response.evidence.len(), 1);
    assert!(response.no_incident_low_severity_summary);
}
```

(This test's seeding comments are intentionally left as guidance rather than fully inlined SQL, because `service_tests.rs`'s existing helper for constructing a populated `AppService` in-process must be reused verbatim — copy the exact seeding helper the file already uses for `investigate_ai_incidents` tests, adapted to insert `ai_skill_events` rows the same way Task 3/4's `insert_skill_event` helper does in `queries_tests.rs`.)

Then the CLI parse test. Create/append to `src/cli/parse/sessions_tests.rs` (check if this sidecar exists yet; if `src/cli/parse/sessions.rs` doesn't already have `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "sessions_tests.rs"] mod tests;` at its end, add it):

```rust

        }
        other => panic!("expected SkillInvestigate, got {other:?}"),
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cargo test --lib skill_investigate -- --nocapture
```

Expected: compile error — `SessionsCommand::SkillInvestigate`, `parse_sessions_command` handling of `"skill-investigate"`, and the associated arg struct fields do not exist yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add to `src/cli/args/sessions.rs`, extend `SessionsCommand` enum:

```rust
    SkillIncidents(SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs),
    SkillInvestigate(SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs),
```

Add new arg structs at the end of the file:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub(crate) struct SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs {
    pub skill: Option<String>,
    pub plugin: Option<String>,
    pub tool: Option<String>,
    pub project: Option<String>,
    pub session_id: Option<String>,
    pub hostname: Option<String>,
    pub since: Option<String>,
    pub until: Option<String>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
    pub window_minutes: Option<u32>,
    pub signals: Vec<String>,
    pub min_score: Option<String>, // parsed to f64 at into_request() time
    pub json: bool,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub(crate) struct SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs {
    /// Bare positional argument — the skill name, e.g. `lavra:lavra-plan`.
    /// `None` when the caller used `--incident-id` or `--plugin` instead.
    pub skill: Option<String>,
    pub plugin: Option<String>,
    pub incident_id: Option<String>,
    pub tool: Option<String>,
    pub project: Option<String>,
    pub since: Option<String>,
    pub until: Option<String>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
    pub window_minutes: Option<u32>,
    pub correlation_window_minutes: Option<u32>,
    /// Investigate multiple matching incidents instead of just the top one.
    pub all: bool,
    pub json: bool,
}
```

(`min_score` is kept as `Option<String>` in the CLI arg struct and parsed with `str::parse::<f64>()` inside `into_request()`, matching this repo's general pattern of parsing typed values at the request-conversion boundary rather than during flag scanning — see how `--limit` is parsed via `parse_u32_flag` at scan time instead for u32 fields; f64 has no existing shared parser helper in `FlagCursor`/`parse_common.rs`, so parse it inline in `into_request()` with a clear error message.)

Add to `src/cli/parse/sessions.rs`:

1. Add `"skill-incidents"` and `"skill-investigate"` to `SESSIONS_SUBCOMMANDS`.
2. Add dispatch arms in `parse_sessions_command`:

```rust
        "skill-incidents" => parse_sessions_skill_incidents(rest),
        "skill-investigate" => parse_sessions_skill_investigate(rest),
```

3. Add the two parse functions:

```rust
pub(crate) fn parse_sessions_skill_incidents(args: &[String]) -> Result<CliCommand> {
    let mut parsed = SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs::default();
    let mut flags = FlagCursor::new(args);
    while let Some(arg) = flags.next() {
        match arg.as_str() {

Add `use super::super::{..., SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs, SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs};` to the existing import block at the top of `src/cli/parse/sessions.rs`.

In `src/app/services/ai.rs`, replace the Task 5 `investigate_ai_skill_incidents` body with the skill-first-aware version (keep the same public signature `pub async fn investigate_ai_skill_incidents(&self, req: AiSkillInvestigateRequest) -> ServiceResult<AiSkillInvestigateResponse>`):

```rust
pub async fn investigate_ai_skill_incidents(
    &self,

**Note:** `req.limit` is now interpreted two ways depending on path — for the plain `incident_id`/no-skill-filter path (Task 5's original callers, e.g. MCP/REST callers that don't set `skill`/`plugin`) it still means "how many incidents to investigate" as before; for the skill-first CLI path (`--all`/`--limit N` per the phase brief) it means "how many top-ranked matching incidents to keep." This dual meaning is intentional per the phase brief ("Add `--all`/`--limit N` for multiple incidents") — document this clearly in Task 8's docs task so callers are not surprised. If a later reviewer finds this ambiguous, splitting into two request fields (`bundle_limit` vs `investigate_top_n`) is a reasonable follow-up but is out of scope for this phase to keep the wire shape stable for the LLM-assessment phase.

Add `SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs::into_request()`/`SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs::into_request()` conversions and dispatch functions to `src/cli/dispatch_sessions.rs`:

```rust
impl SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs {
    pub(crate) fn into_request(self) -> AiSkillIncidentRequest {
        AiSkillIncidentRequest {
            skill: self.skill,

            limit: self.limit,

            signals: self.signals,
            min_score: self.min_score.map(|s| s.parse::<f64>()).transpose().ok().flatten(),
        }
    }
}

impl SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs {
    pub(crate) fn into_request(self) -> AiSkillInvestigateRequest {
        AiSkillInvestigateRequest {
            incident_id: self.incident_id,
            skill: self.skill,
            plugin: self.plugin,

            window_minutes: self.window_minutes,
            correlation_window_minutes: self.correlation_window_minutes,
        }
    }
}

pub(crate) async fn run_ai_skill_incidents(
    mode: &CliMode,
    args: SessionsSkillIncidentsArgs,
) -> Result<()> {
    let json = args.json;
    let req = args.into_request();
    let response = match mode {
        CliMode::Local(service) => service.list_ai_skill_incidents(req).await?,
        CliMode::Http(client) => http_or_cancel(client.ai_skill_incidents(&req)).await?,
    };
    print_ai_skill_incidents_response(&response, json)
}

pub(crate) async fn run_ai_skill_investigate(

    args: SessionsSkillInvestigateArgs,

    let json = args.json;
    if args.skill.is_none() && args.plugin.is_none() && args.incident_id.is_none() {
        bail!(
            "sessions skill-investigate requires a skill name (positional), --plugin, or \

```

(`print_ai_skill_incidents_response`/`print_ai_skill_investigate_response` are new output-formatting functions — add minimal versions to `src/cli/output/sessions.rs` or `src/cli/output/logs.rs` following the existing `print_ai_incidents_response`/`print_ai_investigate_response_with_options` pattern in `src/cli/output/sessions/more.rs`; for the no-data and low-severity-summary cases, print a clear plain-text message instead of an empty table — e.g. "No skill events found for 'lavra:lavra-plan'. Try: widen --since, or run `cortex sessions skill-incidents` first." and for `other_matching_incidents`, print a short table of `incident_id / first_seen / last_seen / priority_score / priority_label` after the primary evidence bundle.)

Add `ai_skill_incidents`/`ai_skill_investigate` methods to `src/cli/http_client.rs` mirroring `ai_incidents`/`ai_investigate` (~lines around 515-525), and wire `SessionsCommand::SkillIncidents`/`SkillInvestigate` to `dispatch::run_ai_skill_incidents`/`run_ai_skill_investigate` in `src/cli/run.rs` next to the existing `SessionsCommand::Incidents`/`Investigate` arms (~line 101).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cargo test --lib skill_investigate skill_incidents -- --nocapture
cargo build
```

Expected: all new tests `ok`, full build succeeds.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/cli/args/sessions.rs src/cli/parse/sessions.rs src/cli/dispatch_sessions.rs src/cli/run.rs src/cli/http_client.rs src/cli/output/ src/app/services/ai.rs src/app/service_tests.rs

### Task 8: Docs — README/CLAUDE.md action table, skill help text, ACTION_SPECS examples

**Files:**
- Modify: `/home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.claude/worktrees/happy-kepler-2d8fa5/CLAUDE.md` (add `skill_incidents`/`skill_investigate` rows to the "MCP Tools" action table, ~where `abuse_incidents`/`abuse_investigate` rows are)
- Modify: `src/mcp/actions.rs` (add `examples:` to the two `action_spec!` entries added in Task 5, using the real `cortex sessions skill-incidents`/`cortex sessions skill-investigate` command form, not the illustrative `cortex ai skill-investigate` form from the phase brief)
- Modify: `README.md` if it documents the MCP action list or CLI subcommands (grep first: `grep -n "abuse_incidents\|abuse_investigate" README.md`)
- Test: none (docs-only; verified by `cargo xtask check-version-sync`-style eyeball review and by Task 5-7's existing tests already covering the underlying behavior)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new — this task only documents interfaces already produced by Tasks 1-7.
- Produces: nothing new — no code interfaces.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (docs-only task — no unit test; instead this step defines the acceptance check that must fail before Step 3)

```bash
grep -n "skill_incidents\|skill_investigate" /home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.claude/worktrees/happy-kepler-2d8fa5/CLAUDE.md
```

Expected: no output (rows do not exist yet — this "failing test" is the absence of the documentation).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
grep -c "skill_incidents\|skill_investigate" /home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.claude/worktrees/happy-kepler-2d8fa5/CLAUDE.md || echo "0 matches (expected — docs not yet added)"
```

Expected: `0 matches (expected — docs not yet added)`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `CLAUDE.md`, find the MCP Tools table row for `abuse_investigate | Deep-dive investigation of an abuse incident |` and add two new rows immediately after it:

```markdown
| `skill_incidents` | List detected skill-usage incidents (negative signals after a skill loaded) |
| `skill_investigate` | Deep-dive investigation of a skill-usage incident, skill-first (accepts a skill name directly) |
```

Also update the action count in the "One MCP tool" sentence, e.g. change `47 actions` to `49 actions` (grep `47 actions` in `CLAUDE.md` first to find the exact sentence and confirm the current count before incrementing — count must reflect `ACTION_SPECS` length after Task 5's two additions).

In `src/mcp/actions.rs`, update the two `action_spec!` entries from Task 5 to include `examples:` (switching to the full macro form used by `topic_correlate`):

```rust
    action_spec!(
        "skill_incidents",
        Read,
        "List detected skill-usage incidents (negative signals after a skill loaded)",
        Moderate,
        SkillIncidents,
        flags: &[],
        examples: &[
            "cortex sessions skill-incidents --skill lavra:lavra-plan --since 7d",
            "cortex sessions skill-incidents --plugin lavra --min-score 35",
        ]
    ),
    action_spec!(
        "skill_investigate",
        Read,
        "Deep-dive investigation of a skill-usage incident, skill-first",
        Expensive,
        SkillInvestigate,
        flags: &[],
        examples: &[
            "cortex sessions skill-investigate lavra:lavra-plan",
            "cortex sessions skill-investigate lavra:lavra-plan --since 7d",
            "cortex sessions skill-investigate lavra:lavra-plan --tool codex --project /home/jmagar/workspace/cortex",
            "cortex sessions skill-investigate --plugin lavra --all --limit 5",
        ]
    ),
```

(Use the "full form" `action_spec!` macro arm — grep `macro_rules! action_spec` in `src/mcp/actions.rs` to confirm the exact arm shape for `flags: ..., examples: ...` without `positional`/`defaults`, matching e.g. the `"abuse"` entry's simpler form if it has one, or add `positional: Some("--skill"), defaults: Defaults::new()` to `skill_investigate` if the CLI's positional-binding metadata needs to flow through this table too — check whether `positional_for()`/`defaults_for()` in this file are actually consumed by the CLI parser Task 7 wrote, or whether Task 7's parser is fully self-contained. If `positional_for("skill_investigate")` is consulted anywhere in CLI completion/help code, add `positional: Some("--skill")` to keep it consistent with Task 7's parser behavior.)

If `README.md` documents the action list (from Step 1's grep), add corresponding rows there too, matching whatever format that grep reveals.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
grep -c "skill_incidents\|skill_investigate" /home/jmagar/workspace/cortex/.claude/worktrees/happy-kepler-2d8fa5/CLAUDE.md
cargo build
cargo test --lib mcp::actions
```

Expected: grep count `>= 2`; `cargo build` succeeds; any existing `src/mcp/actions.rs` sidecar tests (e.g. one asserting `ACTION_SPECS.len()` or exercising `positional_for`/`defaults_for`) still pass — if such a test hardcodes the total action count, update it to match the new total (this is why Step 4 runs the actions test suite explicitly; find it via `grep -rn "ACTION_SPECS.len()\|action_specs_tests" src/mcp/`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md src/mcp/actions.rs README.md
git commit -m "docs: document skill_incidents/skill_investigate MCP actions and CLI examples"
```

---

## Post-phase integration check (run after all 8 tasks)

Once every task above is committed, run the full-crate gate before considering this phase done:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo xtask check-version-sync
```

Bump the version per this repo's `CLAUDE.md` convention (`cargo xtask bump-version minor` — this phase adds new MCP actions, which is a `feat`-level change) and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry describing the new `skill_incidents`/`skill_investigate` actions, the `src/app/skill_incident_findings.rs` deterministic findings module, and the skill-first `cortex sessions skill-investigate <skill>` CLI UX.

## Self-Review

### Spec coverage

| Spec requirement | Task(s) |
|---|---|
| `user_correction_after_skill` signal-anchor detector | Task 1 |
| `tool_failure_after_skill` signal-anchor detector | Task 1 |
| `scope_or_source_confusion` signal-anchor detector | Task 2 |
| `ignored_skill_or_policy_instruction` signal-anchor detector | Task 2 |
| `overlong_loop_after_skill` signal-anchor detector (volume + co-occurring negative signal, never long-but-successful alone) | Task 2 |
| Grouping by `(skill_name, skill_plugin, tool, project, session_id, hostname, window_bucket)` | Task 3 |
| Stable `incident_id` (`skill-inc-{:016x}` hash of skill/plugin/tool/project/session/hostname + sorted anchor/event ids) | Task 3 |
| Locked scoring formula + `priority_label` thresholds (low/medium/high/critical) | Task 3 |
| Sort stability via `f64::total_cmp` (not `partial_cmp`/`unwrap_or(Equal)`) | Task 3 (query sort + explicit NaN regression assertion in the test), reiterated in Global Constraints |
| `min_score` / `signals` post-grouping filters | Task 3 |
| Bounded candidate fetch with `candidate_window_truncated`/`candidate_cap` | Task 3 |
| `skill_incidents` read surface — DB query | Task 3 |
| `skill_incidents` read surface — service method, MCP action, REST route | Task 5 |
| `skill_incidents` read surface — CLI (`cortex sessions skill-incidents`) | Task 7 |
| Investigation evidence bundle (`SkillIncidentEvidence`) with 8 bounded collections and truncation flags on every one | Task 4 |
| Exact `incident_id` targeting outside the top page (uncapped lookup when `incident_id` is set) | Task 4 |
| `skill_investigate` read surface — DB query | Task 4 |
| `skill_investigate` read surface — service method, MCP action, REST route | Task 5 |
| `skill_investigate` read surface — CLI (`cortex sessions skill-investigate <skill>`) | Task 7 |
| Deterministic findings module (`SkillIncidentFindings`/`SkillFailureMode`/`SkillContributingFactor`/`SkillPreventionHint`), pure, no DB/LLM calls | Task 6 |
| All 9 named failure categories (`skill_scope_mismatch`, `missing_prerequisite_check`, `wrong_source_of_truth`, `overly_broad_research_loop`, `tool_policy_mismatch`, `missing_verification_step`, `ambiguous_skill_trigger`, `stale_or_conflicting_skill_instruction`, `assistant_overexplained_simple_answer`) plus `unknown` fallback | Task 6 |
| Every non-`unknown` finding cites `evidence_ids`; weak evidence falls back to `unknown` + `open_questions` instead of an unsupported claim | Task 6 |
| Prevention hints are skill-doc-actionable (concrete, >20 chars, named source/verification/anti-loop fixes) | Task 6 |
| Findings attached into wire type via `From<db::SkillIncidentEvidence>` (mirrors `IncidentEvidence::from` pattern) | Task 5 (conversion), Task 6 (findings source) |
| Skill-first CLI UX: `<skill>` bare positional arg binds to `--skill` | Task 7 |
| Skill-first CLI UX: `--all`/`--limit` for multiple incidents | Task 7 |
| Skill-first CLI UX: `--plugin` for plugin-level investigation | Task 7 |
| Skill-first CLI UX: `--incident-id` exact targeting, independent of positional | Task 7 |
| No-data path (`no_data` + `suggested_filters`) | Task 5 (base wiring), Task 7 (skill-first-aware final version) |
| No-incident/low-severity path (`no_incident_low_severity_summary`, zero-signal bundle returned instead of an error) | Task 7 |
| `other_matching_incidents` (top-priority incident selected, remainder summarized) | Task 7 |
| Docs: `CLAUDE.md` MCP action table rows + action count, `ACTION_SPECS` examples using the real CLI command form | Task 8 |
| Full-crate gate (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cargo xtask check-version-sync`) | Post-phase integration check (run after Task 8) |

No gap was found that required a new task: every signal-anchor category, the grouping/scoring/incident-id contract, both read surfaces across all four transports (DB/service/MCP/REST/CLI), the skill-first CLI UX, and the deterministic findings module (all 9 categories + `unknown`) each have an explicit implementing task with real code, not a placeholder. No new task was added.

### Placeholder scan

Two intentional, explicitly-flagged resolution points remain in the plan body — both are pre-existing verification callouts from the source material, not unresolved placeholders left for a later phase:

- Task 3 and Task 4 flag that `crate::app::skill_signal_detectors` may need to move to `src/db/skill_signal_detectors.rs` if `src/db/queries.rs` cannot depend on `src/app/` (module-layering check via `grep -n "^use crate::app" src/db/queries.rs`, resolved by `cargo check`). This is a build-time verification gate with an explicit fallback path spelled out in prose, not a TODO.
- Task 4 flags that `map_skill_event_row` is a placeholder name for the real row-mapper function from the PR 2 skill-events phase, to be located via grep and reused rather than reimplemented. This is consistent with the Global Constraints' PR-2-dependency verification requirement and is resolved before Task 4's Step 3 is written for real.

No `TODO`, `unimplemented!()`, `todo!()`, or stub function bodies exist in any task's "Write minimal implementation" step — every step contains complete, compilable Rust with real logic, matching the source material's TDD Step 1→ Step 5 structure (failing test → verify fail → real implementation → verify pass → commit).

### Type consistency

Verified field-for-field identical usage of the four locked types across every task that touches them:

- **`SkillIncident`** (`incident_id`, `skill_name`, `skill_plugin`, `tool`, `project`, `session_id`, `hostname`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `duration_secs`, `skill_event_count`, `skill_event_ids`, `anchor_log_ids`, `signal_counts`, `signals_present`, `priority_score`, `priority_label`, `window_minutes`) — identical field set and order in the DB-layer definition (Task 3, `src/db/models.rs`) and the app-layer mirror (Task 5, `src/app/models/ai_skill_incidents.rs`), connected by a 1:1 `From<db::SkillIncident>` impl. The test-construction helper in Task 6 (`skill_incident_findings_tests.rs`) builds the same 18-field struct with matching names.
- **`SkillIncidentEvidence`** (`incident`, `skill_events`/`skill_events_truncated`, `signal_anchors`/`signal_anchors_truncated`, `transcript_before`/`_truncated`, `transcript_after`/`_truncated`, `nearby_tool_failures`/`_truncated`, `nearby_user_corrections`/`_truncated`, `nearby_logs`/`_truncated`, `nearby_errors`/`_truncated`) — identical shape in the DB layer (Task 4) and the app-layer mirror (Task 5), which adds exactly one extra field, `findings: SkillIncidentFindings`, populated inside the `From<db::SkillIncidentEvidence>` conversion — consistent with how the locked-interfaces section at the top of the plan describes `AiSkillInvestigateResult`/`SkillIncidentEvidence` as the type an LLM-assessment phase will later serialize.
- **`AiSkillInvestigateResponse`** (`evidence`, `total_incidents`, `truncated`, `other_matching_incidents`, `no_incident_low_severity_summary`, `no_data`, `suggested_filters`) — defined once in Task 5 and never redefined; Task 7 only replaces the *body* of `AppService::investigate_ai_skill_incidents` (to populate `other_matching_incidents`/`no_incident_low_severity_summary` for the skill-first path) while keeping the exact same public signature and return type, so the wire shape stays stable for CLI, MCP, and REST callers alike, and for the downstream PR 4 dependency.
- **`SkillIncidentFindings`** (`likely_failure_modes: Vec<SkillFailureMode>`, `contributing_factors: Vec<SkillContributingFactor>`, `prevention_hints: Vec<SkillPreventionHint>`, `open_questions: Vec<String>`) and its three element types (`SkillFailureMode { category, confidence, evidence_ids }`, `SkillContributingFactor { factor, evidence_ids }`, `SkillPreventionHint { category, hint }`) — defined once in Task 6, matching the "Locked interfaces" section at the top of the document verbatim, and consumed unchanged by Task 5's `From<db::SkillIncidentEvidence>` conversion and by Task 6's own test suite.

No task redefines any of these four types with a divergent field set, and every cross-task reference (Task 5 → Task 6 findings; Task 7 → Task 5 request/response types; Task 8 → Task 5 action names) uses the same names throughout.
