## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `cortex` | Client-facing documentation for the cortex MCP tool and its action dispatch. |
| `troubleshoot` | Narrow troubleshooting decision tree for MCP, ingest, service, and missing-host issues. |
| `report` | Generate actionable 24-hour markdown reports from cortex MCP evidence. |
| `redeploy` | Re-run the plugin setup hook and verify health plus runtime freshness. |
| `logs` | Tail or follow cortex service logs from Docker Compose. |
| `version-check` | Check whether the running container matches the local Compose image. `--pull` checks after refreshing the local image; without it, Docker checks only the local cache. |
| `incidents` | Triage unacknowledged error signatures, review recent notifications, find prior incidents, and pull full incident context. |
| `topology` | Answer homelab topology and cross-host correlation questions via `map`/`host_state`/`fleet_state`/`correlate`/`correlate_state`/`graph`. |
| `session-search` | Search and explore AI transcript sessions (Claude Code/Codex/Gemini). |
| `frustration-assessment` | Analyze an `abuse_investigate` evidence bundle into a frustration/abuse report. |
| `mcp-friction-assessment` | Analyze an `mcp_investigate` evidence bundle for MCP tool reliability issues. |
| `hook-friction-assessment` | Analyze a `hook_investigate` evidence bundle for hook reliability issues. |
| `skill-improvement-assessment` | Analyze a `skill_investigate` evidence bundle for skill-quality issues. |

### Contents

`plugins/cortex/skills/cortex/SKILL.md` includes:
- Tool inventory (1 tool: `cortex`, with the current MCP action set described)
- Parameter reference for each tool
- FTS5 query syntax guide
- Common workflow patterns (health check, incident investigation, host onboarding)
- Severity level reference (emerg through debug)

### Validation

```bash
just validate-skills
# Checks skill definitions under plugins/cortex/skills/
```

## Adding a skill

If additional skills are needed:

1. Create `plugins/cortex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. Add frontmatter with `name` and `description`
3. Document tools, workflows, and examples
4. Run `just validate-skills`
