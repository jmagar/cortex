#   - new_key_count: canonical rows ('logical_service:plex',

# This script is read-only by default and REFUSES any live rebuild. To
# rebuild for real: take a WAL-safe backup first (`cortex db backup`), run
# `cortex graph rebuild` off-peak with a timeout, then re-run this script
# and assert old_key_count=0.
