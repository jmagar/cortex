description: Triage and manage cortex-detected incidents — unacknowledged error signatures, recent notification firings, similar past incidents, and full incident context around a time window. Use whenever the user asks "what errors haven't been addressed", "what's still firing", "have we seen this before", "ack this error", "acknowledge this signature", "what notifications went out recently", or wants a full picture of what happened around an incident.

# Cortex Incident Management

Triage the error-signature backlog, review recent alert firings, find prior
occurrences of a problem, and pull full context around a time window. This
skill is for incident-response workflows — not general log search (use
`cortex` for that) and not connection/service failures (use
`troubleshoot` for that).

## Workflow

### 1. Find what's unaddressed

Start here for "what's still open" / "what haven't we fixed" questions.

`cortex action=unaddressed_errors [limit=N] [include_acknowledged=true]`
(CLI: `cortex alerts signatures [--include-acknowledged] [--limit N]`)

Returns `signatures[]`, each with a `signature_hash` (the stable key for
everything downstream), a `template`/`sample_message`, `severity`,
`sample_hostname`, `first_seen_at`/`last_seen_at`, `total_count`, and
`count_last_1h`. By default only unacknowledged signatures are returned —
pass `include_acknowledged=true` to see the full set including ones already
handled.

Triage priority: high `count_last_1h` (still actively firing) beats high
`total_count` alone (could be a stale, no-longer-occurring pattern).

### 2. Acknowledge or un-acknowledge a signature

Once a signature is understood and either fixed or explicitly accepted as
known/benign, acknowledge it so it drops out of the default
`unaddressed_errors` view:

`cortex action=ack_error signature_hash=<hash> [notes="..."]`
(CLI: `cortex alerts signatures ack <signature_hash> [--notes TEXT]`)

To reverse a bad acknowledgement (e.g. it turned out not to be fixed):

`cortex action=unack_error signature_hash=<hash> [reason="..."]`
(CLI: `cortex alerts signatures unack <signature_hash> [--reason TEXT]`)

Both are **admin-scoped actions** — they require `cortex:admin` (static
bearer tokens need `CORTEX_STATIC_TOKEN_ADMIN=true`). Always state which
signature you're acknowledging and why before calling `ack_error` — this is
a state-changing action, not a read.

### 3. Check what's already been notified

`cortex action=notifications_recent [rule_id=... ] [since=...] [limit=N]`
(CLI: `cortex alerts notifications [--rule-id ID] [--since TIME] [--limit N]`)

Use this to answer "did we already get paged for this" before re-raising
something, or to confirm a notification rule actually fired when expected.

### 4. Check whether this has happened before

`cortex action=similar_incidents query="<free text>" [host=...] [app=...] [severity_min=...] [since=...] [until=...] [window_minutes=N] [limit=N]`
(CLI: `cortex sessions similar "<query>" [--host H] [--app A] [--severity-min S] [--since T] [--until T] [--window-minutes N] [--limit N]`)

This clusters matching logs into `IncidentCluster`s (`window_start`/
`window_end`, `log_count`, `severity_peak`, `representative_messages`,
correlated AI sessions if any). Use the error's `template`/`sample_message`
from step 1 as the `query` when following up on a specific signature.

### 5. Pull full context around a window

`cortex action=incident_context since=<ISO> until=<ISO> [host=...] [app=...] [query=...] [severity_min=...] [limit=N]`
(CLI: `cortex sessions incidentcontext --since <ISO> --until <ISO> [--host H] [--app A] [--query Q] [--severity-min S] [--limit N]`)

Both `since` and `until` are **required** — there is no incident-id concept
that threads automatically from the earlier steps into this one. Build the
window yourself: pad a signature's `first_seen_at`/`last_seen_at` (step 1)
or a cluster's `window_start`/`window_end` (step 4) by a few minutes on
each side, then pass that as `since`/`until` here.

Returns severity/app breakdowns for the window plus the actual `error_logs`
and any correlated `ai_sessions` — this is the "show me everything that was
happening" view once you already know roughly when and where.

## Composing the workflow

A typical incident triage session chains these in sequence: `unaddressed_errors`
to find a candidate signature → `similar_incidents` with that signature's
message to see if it's recurring → `incident_context` with a padded window
from either result to see the full blast radius → `ack_error` once you've
confirmed it's handled (or filed a follow-up) — never ack a signature you
haven't actually investigated just to clear the list.

## Guardrails

- `ack_error`/`unack_error` change state. Confirm the signature and
  rationale with the user before calling them unless they've already asked
  you to acknowledge a specific, named signature.
- Don't ack a signature solely because `count_last_1h` is 0 — a quiet
  signature can still represent an unfixed root cause that simply isn't
  triggering right now.
- Don't claim an incident is "new" or "unprecedented" without running
  `similar_incidents` first — recurring problems are common in this fleet
  and the whole point of this skill is catching that.
- When quoting `sample_message`/`representative_messages`/`error_logs`,
  keep quotes short and paraphrase the rest; don't dump full log bodies
  into the response.
