# Frustration Assessment — inc-00000000deadbeef

## 1. Signal Authenticity

**Classification: Real frustration**

The anchor message at 2026-01-15T14:32:07Z contains "this is fucking broken" in a direct complaint to the agent, not in quoted code or an error message. The surrounding `transcript_before` shows three consecutive failed attempts before the anchor, supporting genuine frustration.

## 2. Timeline

| Time | Source | Event |
|------|--------|-------|
| 14:28:02 | transcript | User asks agent to run migration |
| 14:28:45 | transcript | Agent runs wrong migration file |
| 14:29:10 | nearby_log | `dockerd` container restart on `db-host` |
| 14:29:50 | transcript | User corrects agent; agent retries same wrong file |
| 14:30:33 | nearby_error | `syslog ERROR: DB connection timeout` |
| 14:32:07 | anchor | User: "this is fucking broken" |

## 3. Why Was the User Frustrated?

1. **Agent mistake (high confidence):** Agent ran the wrong migration file twice despite explicit correction. Evidence: transcript entries at 14:28:45 and 14:29:50.
2. **External factor (medium confidence):** DB connection timeout at 14:30:33 may have caused the second failure, compounding frustration.

## 4. External Factors

- `2026-01-15T14:29:10Z` — `dockerd` restart on `db-host` (source: `docker://db-host/postgres/stdout`). Likely caused the connection timeout 80 seconds later.
- `2026-01-15T14:30:33Z` — `DB connection timeout` in `syslog` with severity `error`. Directly adjacent to the second migration failure.

## 5. Good Practices

- User provided a clear correction at 14:29:50 with the exact file path.
- Agent acknowledged the correction before retrying (though it still used the wrong file).

## 6. Improvement Opportunities

- **Agent should verify the file path before executing**: Before running a migration, the agent should read the file header or confirm the schema version matches the user's expectation.
- **DB restarts should surface in agent context**: If the `dockerd` restart had been visible to the agent, it could have waited for DB recovery before retrying.

## 7. Recurring Trends

Single incident. No trend data available.

## 8. Follow-Up Actions

No Beads created — the agent error was a one-time failure mode that is addressed by the verification improvement above. The DB restart is a system-level issue already tracked separately.

---

**Executive Summary:** The user's frustration was real and caused primarily by an agent mistake (running the wrong migration file twice). A concurrent DB restart compounded the failure. The agent acknowledged corrections but did not apply them correctly. Recommend adding a pre-migration file verification step. No Beads created as the issue is isolated and improvement is straightforward.
