//! Canonical-entity-resolution projection glue.
//!
//! Converts deterministic entity-resolver decisions (canonical
//! `logical_service` / `service_instance` identity derived from structured
//! agent-Docker metadata) into investigation-graph rows, plus the two other
//! genuinely resolver-specific, cleanly-separable pieces that consume that
//! projection: the bounded service-topic graph walk and the legacy
//! pre-resolver topology cleanup.
//!
//! Extracted from `graph.rs` (syslog-mcp-6ipjl). The shared extraction
//! machinery this glue calls into — `EntityMemo`, `ensure_entity_memoized`,
//! `ensure_relationship_with_evidence`, `LogGraphRow`, `EvidenceInput`, and
//! the rest of the `extract_*_row` dispatch family — stays in `graph.rs`
//! because it is general-purpose (shared by every extractor, not just the
//! resolver path); moving it here would drag along the whole dispatch tree.
//! This module owns only the pieces that are cleanly separable from that
//! machinery and specific to projecting resolver decisions.
